      <p>If there&rsquo;s one common thread between <a href="http://educationnext.org/taking-a-lesson-from-the-boys-in-the-boat-and-aiming-for-swing/">Robin Lake relating <em>The Boys in the Boat</em> to schools</a>, <a href="https://relinquishment.org/2016/08/21/an-alternative-interpretation-of-the-fryer-dobbie-texas-charter-study/">Neerav Kingsland on a recent charter study</a>, and <a href="http://educationnext.org/growing-up-poor-and-white-in-america-a-view-from-the-inside/">Robert Pondiscio on <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em></a>, it&rsquo;s that culture plays a huge role in education. <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w22541">A new NBER Working Paper</a> provides powerful evidence that it may be even more critical than was previously understood.</p>

<p>The authors examine the performance of first and second generation immigrant students in Florida to understand the relationship between the &ldquo;long-term orientation&rdquo; of the cultures they come from to their educational outcomes. They find that students from families from countries with a high degree of long-term orientation score higher <em>and</em> grow more over time than similar students from countries with lower long-term orientation. They also are more likely to have better attendance, fewer disciplinary incidents, and enroll in more advanced classes.</p>

<p>To put the size of the &ldquo;long-term orientation&rdquo; effect into context, the authors note that their data showed that a student of a mother holding a college degree scored 40% higher in math than the child of a high school dropout. The same data shows that holding everything else equal, moving from the lowest long-term orientation measure (Puerto Rico) to the highest (South Korea) translates to a <strong>73% higher math score</strong>, almost twice the impact of a parent with a college education compared to a high school dropout.</p>

<p>Education reform is often focused on factors that can be addressed via policy change, like human capital management, standards/curriculum, and school governance/accountability. Yet as challenging as those issues are, we can&rsquo;t ignore the power of culture, and more specifically, values that support delayed gratification. <a href="https://edexcellence.net/events/education-for-upward-mobility">Fordham&rsquo;s Education for Upward Mobility</a> conference is a start, but given the power of culture to impact educational outcomes, this conversation deserves a more prominent place within the ed reform community.</p>
