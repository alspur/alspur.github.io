      <p>After 11 years of litigation, Judge Thomas Moukawsher <a href="http://ctmirror.org/2016/09/07/judge-strikes-down-state-education-aid-choices-as-irrational/">issued a seismic decision in the CCJEF school finance lawsuit</a>. In <a href="http://www.jud.ct.gov/CCJEFvRell.pdf">the decision</a>, Moukawsher not only eviscerated Connecticut&rsquo;s school finance system, he also detailed flaws in the state&rsquo;s approach to teacher evaluation, teacher compensation, the lack of clear definitions of success in elementary and secondary education, and gave the state 180 days to come up with a solution to all of it.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to digest, but here are my initial thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s good to see the ruling bring more attention to the distribution of funding than the overall allocation. As I argued nearly two years ago, <a href="http://alspur.com/athoughtexperiment/">actual appropriations are not driven by the ECS formula</a>, leading to huge funding disparities (positive and negative) that affect thousands of students.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m sympathetic with the desire for better approaches to teacher evaluation and compensation, I&rsquo;m not sure the order in this ruling is the best way to actually improve how those systems operate. To <a href="http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-missing-half-of-school-reform">paraphrase Rick Hess</a>, while judicial orders can make people do things, it cannot make people do those things well.</li>
<li>The timeline is super-aggressive. Staffers at the Connecticut State Department of Education are going to have a busy winter.</li>
<li>Will the state&rsquo;s proposed solution include magnets, charters, and/or other choice options? The state <a href="http://alspur.com/outdated-funding-systems/">already spends a significant amount of funding</a> on these schools and the ruling sounds like a mandate for a comprehensive solution. It will be interesting to see how they address this question.</li>
</ul>

<p>There&rsquo;s much more to digest in this decision. While the plaintiffs got a partial victory, they&rsquo;re about to learn an important lesson:</p>

<p>Winning is easy. <a href="http://genius.com/7856447">Governing&rsquo;s harder.</a></p>
