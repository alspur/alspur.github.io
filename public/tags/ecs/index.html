     <p>The <a href="http://ctmirror.org/2015/06/01/deal-on-charter-school-conflict-more-funding-all-around/">CT Mirror reports</a> that Governor Malloy and Democratic legislators struck a budget deal that would allow two new charter schools to open as well as supporting the growth of existing charter schools.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>On paper, this charter growth will cost the state $12.4 million in FY16, but it actually took an additional $23.5 million increase in FY16 ECS funding to make it happen. In other words, for every $1 in new funding to support growth in charter schools, legislators insisted that $2 went to support traditional public schools via ECS grants.</p>

<p><a href="http://alspur.com/tough-choices.html">As I&rsquo;ve noted</a>, it&rsquo;s much easier for legislators to give districts more money instead of addressing the inconsistent distribution of current ECS funding. The question I&rsquo;d like to address: how well does this budget distribute the new ECS funding?</p>

<hr />

<p>Looking at towns&rsquo; ECS funding gap compared to their increase in ECS funding by FY17, we see that there&rsquo;s a trend, but it&rsquo;s not very clear. Towns with larger gaps will see a larger boost in their ECS grants, but towns with similar gaps are getting very different increases:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/ecstargets/master/figures/finalBudgetDollarChange.png" alt="gapchangedollar" /></p>

<p>If we take a slightly different look at the changes, this time in percentages, the distribution of new ECS funding starts to make a little more sense:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/ecstargets/master/figures/finalBudgetPctChange.png" alt="gapchangepct" /></p>

<p>This chart shows a tighter correlation between the percentage of the fully-funded ECS grant towns currently receive and the percentage increase in their ECS grant by FY17. Towns that currently get the smallest percentage of their ECS grant target amount will receive the largest percentage increases in funding, while towns getting a higher percentage will see a smaller increase in funding.</p>

<p>Of course, there are exceptions.</p>

<p>By FY17, the ECS grant will be 77.9% funded, but 47 towns with more than 78% of their target ECS grant will see an increase in funding. This comes at the expense of towns that are still significantly under-funded compared to their ECS target. For example, Milford won&rsquo;t see their ECS grant increase by a single penny, even though they get less than 40% of their target ECS grant.</p>

<p>To put it in perspective, this is what the distribution of ECS grant &ldquo;percent funded&rdquo; will look like by FY17 (the first chart has a normal x-axis, while the second uses a logarithmic scale to better illustrate the left side of the distribution):</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/ecstargets/master/figures/finalBudgetFY17fundedPct.png" alt="pctdistribution" /></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/ecstargets/master/figures/finalBudgetFY17fundedPctLog.png" alt="pctdistribtuionlog" /></p>

<p>To answer my original question, how well is this new ECS funding being spent?</p>

<p>The new funding will do some good for under-funded districts, but the following problems persist:</p>

<ul>
<li>Over-funded towns with low levels of poverty will continue to get more than their fair share in ECS grants.</li>
<li>The ECS formula still doesn&rsquo;t fully account for the impact of concentrated poverty.</li>
<li>Choice programs, including charters, magnets, and vo-tech schools, are still funded via separate line items.</li>
</ul>

<p>Much more work remains to be done.</p>

<li id="fn:1">According to another <a href="http://ctmirror.org/2015/06/03/house-debate-begins-on-fiercely-contested-state-budget-deal/">CT Mirror article</a>, the additional funding will allow current charter schools to add approximately 700 students across the state. The new charters slated to open this fall in Stamford and Bridgeport would serve 168 and 250 students, respectively, in their first year of operation.

     <div class="article-content">
        
     <p>There are few people in Connecticut defending the current system of distributing Education Cost Sharing (ECS) grants. Sure, there&rsquo;s a formula that is supposed to guide annual appropriations, but there are two big problems. To start, the legislature hasn&rsquo;t ever appropriated the level of funding the formula calls for. Given the economic tumult of the past decade and Connecticut&rsquo;s somewhat anemic growth rate, it&rsquo;s not hard to understand why this is the case.</p>

<p>Less understandable is how the legislature chose to allocate ECS funding. According to <a href="http://www.ctvoices.org/sites/default/files/040215_approps_sb816_ecsmin50pct.pdf">testimony submitted by Connecticut Voices for Children</a>, the line item for ECS grants is about 77% of what it ought to be if it were fully funded. As I&rsquo;ve noted in <a href="http://alspur.com/a-thought-experiment.html">a previous post</a>, some towns get much less than what they should expect at this funding level and some get more. A lot more.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/ecstargets/master/figures/ecsFRPL.png" alt="ecsfrpl" /></p>

<p>The chart above illustrates how close each town is to their targeted grant at a 77% funding level compared to the town&rsquo;s level of student poverty<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s pretty clear that there are many towns with low levels of poverty getting much more than they should be getting in ECS funding. Here&rsquo;s the same chart with a logarithmic scale on the y-axis to make it easier to see which towns we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/ecstargets/master/figures/ecsFRPLlog.png" alt="ecsfrpllog" /></p>

<p>Looking at this problem in real dollars shows a slightly different picture. A few towns (West Hartford, Danbury, Milford) are underfunded by millions and millions of dollars, while the big urban centers (Hartford, Bridgeport, New Haven) are getting at least $10 million more than they are supposed to receive.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/ecstargets/master/figures/ecsFRPLdollar.png" alt="ecsfrpldollar" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not too worried about the big cities getting relatively more funding at this point. Our state&rsquo;s education funding formula should gives more weight than it currently does to students with additional learning needs and to towns with high concentrations of poverty. These cities have both, so I think this divergence from their adjusted ECS grant is justifiable.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s much more difficult to come up with a good reason for overfunding districts with low levels of poverty. In effect, our state is providing extra subsidies to school systems in some of the most affluent communities in the state at a time when many school systems are struggling with their towns to meet the needs of their students.</p>

<hr />

<p>###What did the Appropriations Committee do to address this problem?</p>

<p>The Connecticut General Assembly&rsquo;s Appropriations Committee attempted to address this issue in their version of the Governor&rsquo;s budget bill, <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=HB06824&amp;which_year=2015">H.B. 6824</a>. While the Governor&rsquo;s initial budget would flat-fund ECS grants for FY16 and FY17, the Appropriations budget would direct an additional $3.7 million in FY16 and $10.6 million in FY17 to some of the most underfunded towns.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all other towns were held harmless, meaning that overfunded towns will continue to enjoy their ECS windfall at the expense of districts with greater financial needs. An updated version of the chart we started with doesn&rsquo;t show a very different picture by FY17.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/ecstargets/master/figures/appropsFRPL.png" alt="appropsfy17" /></p>

<hr />

<p>###Making hard choices</p>

<p>What would happen if our legislators decided to end the overfunding of districts with lower levels of poverty? Would we be able to end some of the most egregious examples of under-funding in the current system of ECS grants?</p>

<p>First, we would need to decide which overfunded towns should lose their windfall. As noted earlier, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s wrong to overfund the big cities given the challenges they face. Instead, I&rsquo;ll pick a limit of 25% Free/Reduced Price Lunch (FRPL) resident students to decide which towns should lose their ECS windfall. More than a third of Connecticut students qualify for FRPL, so I think it&rsquo;s a fair cutoff to determine &ldquo;lower poverty&rdquo; towns.</p>

<p>So how many towns are overfunded and have fewer than 25% of their resident students in poverty? Ten? Twenty? Nope - the answer is 88. In other words, <strong>more than half of Connecticut&rsquo;s 169 towns are lower-poverty towns getting more ECS funding than they ought to - about $59 million extra each year.</strong></p>

<p>That $59 million in overfunding to towns like Greenwich, Fairfield, and Guilford could go a long way towards bringing some of the most underfunded towns closer to their ECS target grants.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we wanted to bring every town up to at least 75% of their adjusted ECS grant<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. This would allow the state to continue providing additional funding to the state&rsquo;s highest-poverty districts while ensuring that no other districts were terribly far off of their adjusted ECS grant. This would cost just under $45 million, but it would still leave a few districts with ECS grants that are millions of dollars less than they should receive.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/ecstargets/master/figures/proposedECS.png" alt="proposedfix" /></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/ecstargets/master/figures/proposedECSdollar.png" alt="proposedfixdollar" /></p>

<p>We could use some of the $14 million left over<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> to ensure that no town was more than $7 million away from their adjusted ECS grant. This would impact four towns (Danbury, Hamden, Stratford, and West Hartford) and cost about $8.3 million.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/ecstargets/master/figures/proposedbonusECSdollars.png" alt="proposedbonusfixdollar" /></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/ecstargets/master/figures/proposedbonusECS.png" alt="proposedbonusfix" /></p>

<p>This would leave $5.7 million that could be used in a variety of ways to help improve the quality of education in Connecticut&rsquo;s most challenging areas instead of subsidizing towns with relatively low levels of student need.</p>

<hr />

<p>I can understand why the Appropriations Committee chose to address towns with severely underfunded ECS grants. It&rsquo;s always easier to give towns more grant money than it is to take it away. It&rsquo;s easy to say that as long as ECS isn&rsquo;t fully funded, that no town should see a cut in their ECS grant.</p>

<p>Those easy choices have consequences. The ECS formula, while flawed in many ways<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, does call for state aid to be distributed according to town wealth and student need. Ignoring the formula&rsquo;s prescribed distribution has placed the state in the position of benefiting pretty affluent towns at the expense of the underfunded towns. In my example above, the towns identified as underfunded had nearly a quarter of their students qualifying for Free/Reduced Price Lunch (22.6%). In the overfunded, low poverty towns, that rate is only 10.9%.</p>

<p>We elect leaders to make hard choices, but they&rsquo;ve been taking the path of least resistance when it comes to ECS. There&rsquo;s no way to get around it: the current distribution of ECS grants benefits our state&rsquo;s wealthiest towns, forcing towns with more students in poverty to rely on local property taxes to make up the difference.</p>

<p>Every year our legislators use the underfunding of ECS as an excuse to continue this practice is another year of additional burden to the students and taxpayers in these communities. It&rsquo;s time to stop taking the easy road and do what&rsquo;s right for our state&rsquo;s towns and students.</p>

     <div class="article-content">
        
     <p>What would happen if we actually followed the ECS formula?</p>

<p>There are two significant flaws in Connecticut&rsquo;s current school funding formula, known as ECS (Education Cost Sharing):</p>

<ol>
<li>It does not reflect the actual needs of towns and students.</li>
<li>It does not treat the thousands of students accessing school choice equitably.</li>
</ol>

<p>I plan on addressing those concerns in subsequent posts, but for a moment, let&rsquo;s take ECS at face value and assume that the underpinnings of the formula are correct. If political processes had not brought Connecticut off of the ECS formula and we distributed current funding according to the formula, how might that change how dollars flow to towns?</p>

<p>Right now, the ECS formula is somewhere around $650 million under-funded. That is to say, the legislature and governor have not found a way to follow the ECS formula as it was originally intended to operate. In lieu of actually following the formula, the money that flows from the state to towns to school districts has been manipulated by politicians each legislative session since the ECS formula was adopted.</p>

<p>What would happen if our elected representatives followed the distributive principles of the ECS formula, so that if the state could only contribute 80% of what the formula dictates, each town would receive 80% of what the ECS formula dictates they should receive?<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> Let&rsquo;s figure it out!</p>

<hr />

<p>In fiscal year 2015 (FY15), ECS was about 75% funded, meaning that the state is paying about three quarters to the dollar of what the ECS formula actually dictates.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME">shocked, shocked to learn</a> that some towns are earning more than 75% of their ECS entitlement, while other earn less!</p>

<p>Which towns are doing better/worse than they should be doing if current dollars were distributed based on the ECS formula?</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the biggest beneficiaries of the current distribution of ECS dollars tend to be <a href="http://www.sde.ct.gov/sde/cwp/view.asp?a=2683&amp;Q=334226">Alliance Districts</a>, a collection of 30 low-performing districts the Malloy administration placed a priority on supporting with additional funding (identified in the table with a *).</p>

<p>Twelve towns are under-funded by at least $5 million according to the current ECS formula. West Hartford falls $20 million short. Danbury is $17 million short and Milford is more than $11 million under-funded:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s surprising to see five Alliance Districts on this list (again, identified with a *). The combined under-funding of these five districts (Danbury, Norwalk, Middletown, Hamden, and Stamford) is about $43 million, which is less than the $60 million over-funding of the big three cities (Bridgeport, Hartford, and New Haven).</p>

<hr />

<p>Looking at raw dollar differences is helpful, but Connecticut is a state with a few large towns and many medium and small towns. Let&rsquo;s compare what towns receive now as a percentage of what they <em>ought to receive if we followed the ECS formula with current appropriations</em>:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/ecstargets/master/figures/ecsPctDiff.png" alt="pctDiffECS" /></p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re able to see which towns are really benefitting from the current flow of ECS funding. There are 53 towns in Connecticut that receive about 32% more ECS funding than they ought to, given the current level of total ECS appropriations. This includes affluent towns like Greenwich, Darien, Fairfield, Madison, and Westport.</p>

<p>Which towns get the short end of the stick? Well, there are a dozen towns that receive less than <em>half</em> what they ought to receive under the ECS formula:</p>

<p>The place I call home, Branford, gets less than a quarter on the dollar of what we <em>should</em> be getting according to ECS with the current level of total funding distributed via the ECS grant.</p>

<hr />

<p>Again, <em>I don&rsquo;t think the current ECS formula is correct</em>,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> but this thought experiment highlights the key challenges of reforming Connecticut&rsquo;s school finance system if we kept total spending flat:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;big three&rdquo; Alliance Districts are doing much better than other Alliance Districts.</strong> Connecticut&rsquo;s big three urban cities (Bridgeport, Hartford, and New Haven) are doing very well under the current flow of ECS dollars, which is in stark contrast to other high-needs towns that are significantly under-funded (Danbury, Norwalk, Middletown, Hamden, and Stamford). In order for the big three to gain funding, there needs to be either an increase in overall funding or adjustments to the ECS formula to more heavily weight for poverty.</li>
<li><strong>There are many (mostly affluent) towns that are receiving more than their fair share.</strong> Many towns have already hit the ceiling on what they should be getting under a fully-funded ECS formula. Any funding reform that gives more weight to towns with high poverty would mean reduced funding for these towns.</li>
<li><strong>Suburbs are getting a raw deal.</strong> While there are some Alliance Districts that are relatively under-funded, the most disadvantaged towns are middle-class suburbs like Branford, Orange, and West Hartford. These are towns that should be pushing for immediate school finance reform, since they would stand to see the largest relative increase in funding, even with no new money added to the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of waiting for a court to compel the legislature to change ECS, leaders of middle-class towns and Alliance Districts should be working to develop an school finance &ldquo;grand bargain&rdquo; that could be implemented without significant additional revenue. This would likely need to include schools of choice (magnets, charters, etc.) along with some sort of regulatory relief to affluent towns that would stand to lose funding.</p>

<p>Will any leaders take on this challenge?</p>

     <p>School finance in Connecticut is broken.</p>

<p>The state&rsquo;s main vehicle of support to public schools, the Education Cost Sharing (ECS) grant, sends $2 billion to local districts each year with the goal of equalizing the ability of communities to fund public education. Unfortunately, years of legislative tinkering with the ECS formula left Connecticut with <a href="ecsformula">a Byzantine approach to funding schools that takes more than 16 pages to explain</a>.</p>

<p>On top of this labyrinthine system, non-traditional public schools (including magnet, charter, vocational/technical, and agriscience schools) <a href="ecstaskforce">are funded under entirely separate mechanisms</a>. In practice, this means that one student could have their education funded up to ten different ways<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This approach makes the bulk of Connecticut&rsquo;s education aid unresponsive to the changing needs of communities and families across our state.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the wake of <a href="tax">the largest tax increase in state history</a> and with <a href="ctatrisk">major financial challenges looming</a>, it&rsquo;s not likely that our state will simply be able to address this problem with a significant cash infusion. <strong>We need to make difficult choices to improve how Connecticut allocates scarce resources for public education.</strong></p>

<p>In the state with <a href="achievementgap">the largest achievement gap in the nation</a>, we need a better way to provide a high-quality public education to every child. I believe that a more equitable and responsive school finance system is an necessary mechanism to achieve that goal.</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t be easy changing the status quo in <a href="steadyhabits">the land of steady habits</a>, but I&rsquo;m going to do my part to move the conversation in a productive direction. In this space, I plan on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Detailing the challenges and competing priorities involved in school finance reform.</li>
<li>Proposing policy approaches that take into account the educational challenges and fiscal realities facing our state.</li>
<li>Transparent analyses of school finance and demographic data. When possible, all code and data will be available on <a href="github">my GitHub page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Connecticut&rsquo;s school finance system is broken. We need to fix it my making some tough policy choices.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get to work.</p>
