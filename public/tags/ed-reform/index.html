     <p>Do low-stakes international assessments of student performance accurately describe student ability? According to this recent NBER Working paper, a country&rsquo;s results may depend on their students&rsquo; intrinsic motivation to do well.</p>

<p>The authors used an experimental approach that offered treatment students a small financial incentive to do well on a test. Students in the treatment group were told just before the test that an envelope with the equivalent of $25 (US) was theirs, but that $1 would be subtracted for each incorrect answer. The researchers conducted the experiment in three high schools in China and two in the US. They found no impact of the financial incentive in China, but the effect size in the US was 0.20-0.23 standard deviations.</p>

<p>The authors conclude that the massive difference in treatment effect between countries indicates that &ldquo;success on low states assessments does not solely reflect differences in ability between students across countries&rdquo; and that &ldquo;low-stakes tests do not measure and compare ability in isolation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this in mind, researchers, policymakers, and the public should be a little more cautious when interpreting the results of low-stakes assessments like PISA. Student motivation clearly plays a significant role in the results of a country&rsquo;s performance - a topic that deserves further investigation. For example, NCES will release new <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/">NAEP results</a> in early 2018. Does student motivation vary significantly for NAEP across state lines? If so, how much of a role (if any) is it contributing to state performance?</p>

<p>Low-stakes assessments can be informative, but they may be measuring more than student ability. This study is a reminder to policymakers and advocates to exercise caution when comparing performance on these tests across jurisdictions.</p>

<p>E.D. Hirsch is a self-described &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox">hedgehog</a>,&rdquo; viewing the world through the lens of one big idea:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;[T]he achievement gap is chiefly a knowledge gap and a language gap. It can be greatly ameliorated by knowledge-based schooling.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The inverse of Hirsch&rsquo;s &ldquo;big idea&rdquo; is the skills-based approach to education that drives instruction in the vast majority of American schools. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Schools-We-Need-Dont-Have/dp/0385495242/">The Schools We Need &amp; Why We Don&rsquo;t Have Them</a>&rdquo; was my first introduction to the &ldquo;knowledge vs. skills&rdquo; debate. This book re-introduces Hirsch&rsquo;s basic case and extends it based on new evidence from the world of cognitive science and the experience of French schools over the past several decades.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-idea">The Big Idea</h2>

<p>Reading, critical thinking, and problem solving are not general skills that can be developed and applied to any context. Like most human skills, they are domain-specific, becoming stronger or weaker based on a person&rsquo;s background knowledge of the topic. Hirsch recommends providing all students with a curriculum in the early grades that focuses on developing knowledge, not skills, to promote equity and achievement among all students.</p>

<h2 id="key-passages">Key Passages</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard many well-intentioned people, including educators, state that in the age of Google, it&rsquo;s less important for students to learn a bunch of information they could just look up. Their belief is that we need to equip students with the critical thinking and problem solving skills to apply these tools to the problems they are tackling.</p>

<p>Hirsch provides a great deal of evidence to support the need focusing on building knowledge instead of generalizable skills, but the most powerful rebuttal to this line of thinking is his explanation of the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">Matthew Effect</a>&rdquo; in education:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reference works, inlcluding those available on the Internet, are immensely valuable to already knowledgeable people. Google is not an equal-opportunity fact-finder; it rewards those already in the know. Instead of being an agent of equality, Google rewards cognitive insiders. It consolidates educational inequity. Just as it takes money to make money, it takes knowledge to gain knowldege.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the book, Hirsch shows how the shift from a universal knowledge-based curriculum in France to a locally-determined and skills-focused approach in 1990 led to disastrous results:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The new localizing and indivudalizing of the schools had been proposed as a way of overcoming the reproduction of social stratification. But the educational results went the opposite way, intensifying inequalities. As the French data from 1987 to 2007 show, the new 1990 arrangements greatly intensified the social reproduction they were supposed to diminish. They systematically deprived poor children of the enabling knowledge that rich children had acquired from their home environments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hirsch&rsquo;s proposed solution, replacing a individual-focused reading curriculum based on &ldquo;leveled readers&rdquo; with a knowledge-centered communal curriculum, is paradoxically a better way to encourage students to develop as individuals:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It must not be assumed that a different approach - whole-class instruction of real books and subject matters - means grey uniformity. On the contrary, real knowledge breeds real interest and individuality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This principle is extended later in the book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s in relation to the community that the individual develops. Only by mastering the shared knowledge and norms of the community can one diverge from those norms effectively.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Core Knowledge curriculum, developed by Hirsch, is one approach to empowering students with a foundation of communal knowledge. He acknowledges that there can be <em>some</em> differentiation in early grade curricula based on local values while still building a strong foundation of knowledge:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rival elementary curriculums may reflect rival values but all responsible ones will exhibit a great deal of overlap - out of a sense of obligation to the children who will need knowledge represented by those words in order to function well in American society.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="actionable-items">Actionable Items</h2>

<p>Hirsch makes a convincing case for the power of a content-rich, coherent, and cumulative curriculum to build a strong foundation of literacy. While <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/never-judge-a-book-by-its-cover-use-student-achievement-instead/">research has shown the strong impact of a high-quality curriculum on student achievement</a>, there&rsquo;s a paucity of publicly available data on school curriculum. In some cases, <a href="https://morganpolikoff.com/2016/01/14/an-awful-lot-of-districts-dont-know-what-textbooks-are-used-in-their-schools/">districts may not even know</a> which textbooks are being used in their classrooms.</p>

<p>One can agree or disagree with the case Hirsch makes, but we should all be able to agree that curricular choices play an important role in student achievement. It would make sense to make information about those choices more transparent so that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Educators would know which schools/districts are using similar/identical approaches, creating opportunities for highly relevant cross-school/district collaboration.</li>
<li>Researchers could evaluate the relative strength/weakness of curriculum implemented in public schools.</li>
<li>School boards and local school councils would have significantly more information to inform adoption/renewal of curriculum.</li>
</ol>

<p>None of this is possible without transparent data on curriculum. Collecting information about such an important component of public education shouldn&rsquo;t require a FOIA request.</p>

     <p>After 11 years of litigation, Judge Thomas Moukawsher <a href="http://ctmirror.org/2016/09/07/judge-strikes-down-state-education-aid-choices-as-irrational/">issued a seismic decision in the CCJEF school finance lawsuit</a>. In <a href="http://www.jud.ct.gov/CCJEFvRell.pdf">the decision</a>, Moukawsher not only eviscerated Connecticut&rsquo;s school finance system, he also detailed flaws in the state&rsquo;s approach to teacher evaluation, teacher compensation, the lack of clear definitions of success in elementary and secondary education, and gave the state 180 days to come up with a solution to all of it.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to digest, but here are my initial thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s good to see the ruling bring more attention to the distribution of funding than the overall allocation. As I argued nearly two years ago, <a href="http://alspur.com/athoughtexperiment/">actual appropriations are not driven by the ECS formula</a>, leading to huge funding disparities (positive and negative) that affect thousands of students.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m sympathetic with the desire for better approaches to teacher evaluation and compensation, I&rsquo;m not sure the order in this ruling is the best way to actually improve how those systems operate. To <a href="http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-missing-half-of-school-reform">paraphrase Rick Hess</a>, while judicial orders can make people do things, it cannot make people do those things well.</li>
<li>The timeline is super-aggressive. Staffers at the Connecticut State Department of Education are going to have a busy winter.</li>
<li>Will the state&rsquo;s proposed solution include magnets, charters, and/or other choice options? The state <a href="http://alspur.com/outdated-funding-systems/">already spends a significant amount of funding</a> on these schools and the ruling sounds like a mandate for a comprehensive solution. It will be interesting to see how they address this question.</li>
</ul>

<p>There&rsquo;s much more to digest in this decision. While the plaintiffs got a partial victory, they&rsquo;re about to learn an important lesson:</p>

<p>Winning is easy. <a href="http://genius.com/7856447">Governing&rsquo;s harder.</a></p>

     <p>If there&rsquo;s one common thread between <a href="http://educationnext.org/taking-a-lesson-from-the-boys-in-the-boat-and-aiming-for-swing/">Robin Lake relating <em>The Boys in the Boat</em> to schools</a>, <a href="https://relinquishment.org/2016/08/21/an-alternative-interpretation-of-the-fryer-dobbie-texas-charter-study/">Neerav Kingsland on a recent charter study</a>, and <a href="http://educationnext.org/growing-up-poor-and-white-in-america-a-view-from-the-inside/">Robert Pondiscio on <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em></a>, it&rsquo;s that culture plays a huge role in education. <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w22541">A new NBER Working Paper</a> provides powerful evidence that it may be even more critical than was previously understood.</p>

<p>The authors examine the performance of first and second generation immigrant students in Florida to understand the relationship between the &ldquo;long-term orientation&rdquo; of the cultures they come from to their educational outcomes. They find that students from families from countries with a high degree of long-term orientation score higher <em>and</em> grow more over time than similar students from countries with lower long-term orientation. They also are more likely to have better attendance, fewer disciplinary incidents, and enroll in more advanced classes.</p>

<p>To put the size of the &ldquo;long-term orientation&rdquo; effect into context, the authors note that their data showed that a student of a mother holding a college degree scored 40% higher in math than the child of a high school dropout. The same data shows that holding everything else equal, moving from the lowest long-term orientation measure (Puerto Rico) to the highest (South Korea) translates to a <strong>73% higher math score</strong>, almost twice the impact of a parent with a college education compared to a high school dropout.</p>

<p>Education reform is often focused on factors that can be addressed via policy change, like human capital management, standards/curriculum, and school governance/accountability. Yet as challenging as those issues are, we can&rsquo;t ignore the power of culture, and more specifically, values that support delayed gratification. <a href="https://edexcellence.net/events/education-for-upward-mobility">Fordham&rsquo;s Education for Upward Mobility</a> conference is a start, but given the power of culture to impact educational outcomes, this conversation deserves a more prominent place within the ed reform community.</p>

     <div class="article-content">
        
     <p>Five years ago, Marc Andressen took to the pages of the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html">Wall Street Journal</a> to describe how software was &ldquo;eating the world&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as online services—from movies to agriculture to national defense. Many of the winners are Silicon Valley-style entrepreneurial technology companies that are invading and overturning established industry structures. Over the next 10 years, I expect many more industries to be disrupted by software, with new world-beating Silicon Valley companies doing the disruption in more cases than not.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to come up with a list of examples of this prediction coming true, from taxis (Uber) to hotels (AirBnB), but software-driven disruption has yet to significantly change K-12 education. Existing online education offerings, such as <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, show promise, but few would argue that their impact on K-12 education to date could be described as anything close to &ldquo;disruptive.&rdquo; <a href="https://jaypgreene.com/2016/08/12/online-courses-may-not-be-the-way-of-the-future/">Jay P. Greene explains</a> why all-online education has failed to gain traction:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Online courses appear to be less effective in getting the average student to learn and I suspect the problem is that teaching online is less able to create social communities and authentic relationships that are necessary to motivate students.  Having a human being in front of students who would be disappointed if students did not learn the material seems important and something that online instruction has not been able to simulate.  Students appear to be better motivated to learn when they have an in-person, authentic relationship with a teacher and when they try to please that teacher by working hard to learn.  Digital instruction or a human being on the other side of the internet may not be able to create that same relationship and motivation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question remains: <em>if</em> K-12 education is going to be disrupted by software, what would it look like? Is there a way to combine the scalability of software with the power of strong interpersonal relationships?</p>

<p>Delving deeper into the disruption of other industries might give us an answer. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/benthompson">Ben Thompson</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/"><em>Aggregation Theory</em></a> provides a great framework to understand how the Internet is changing entire sectors of our economy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The value chain for any given consumer market is divided into three parts: suppliers, distributors, and consumers/users. The best way to make outsize profits in any of these markets is to either gain a horizontal monopoly in one of the three parts or to integrate two of the parts such that you have a competitive advantage in delivering a vertical solution. In the pre-Internet era the latter depended on controlling distribution.</p>

<p>For example, printed newspapers were the primary means of delivering content to consumers in a given geographic region, so newspapers integrated backwards into content creation (i.e. supplier) and earned outsized profits through the delivery of advertising. A similar dynamic existed in all kinds of industries, such as book publishers (distribution capabilities integrated with control of authors), video (broadcast availability integrated with purchasing content), taxis (dispatch capabilities integrated with medallions and car ownership), hotels (brand trust integrated with vacant rooms), and more. Note how the distributors in all of these industries integrated backwards into supply: there have always been far more users/consumers than suppliers, which means that in a world where transactions are costly owning the supplier relationship provides significantly more leverage.</p>

<p>The fundamental disruption of the Internet has been to turn this dynamic on its head. First, the Internet has made distribution (of digital goods) free, neutralizing the advantage that pre-Internet distributors leveraged to integrate with suppliers. Secondly, the Internet has made transaction costs zero, making it viable for a distributor to integrate forward with end users/consumers at scale.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Applying <em>Aggregation Theory</em>, K-12 schools can be viewed as an industry that integrates the supply and distribution of educational content. Like newspapers, this integrated product is limited to a certain geographic area. It also helps us to understand that most popular education reforms only seek to improve certain aspects of this relationship instead of fundamentally changing it. For example, charter schools may introduce more competition for students (customers), but they still (generally) operate with the same model of integrated supply and distribution of educational content to students.</p>

<p>Some tech companies are trying to flip the equation by integrating the delivery of educational content more directly with the student experience, making the actual content more of a modular component. <a href="https://www.apple.com/education/products/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/edu/products/productivity-tools/classroom/">Google</a>, and <a href="http://summitbasecamp.org/">Facebook (in collaboration with Summit Charter Schools)</a> each offer products that allow teachers to provide a digital classroom experience for their students while also maintaining in-person relationships. This may help them avoid the pitfalls of the all-online education efforts identified by Green, but can any of them truly change the integration of content and delivery in K-12 education?</p>

<p>Of the three large tech companies, I think the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/technology/facebook-helps-develop-software-that-puts-students-in-charge-of-their-lesson-plans.html?_r=0">Facebook/Summit approach</a> has the most potential to deliver <em>Aggregation Theory</em>-style disruption. The online classroom products of Apple and Google are mostly abstractions of a traditional classroom in the cloud: teachers assign work to each student, then students submit it by a given due date. All of this happens online, but everyone in the class is still on the same timeline.</p>

<p>The Facebook/Summit collaboration, named <a href="http://www.summitbasecamp.org">Basecamp</a>, takes <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/netflix-and-the-conservation-of-attractive-profits/">a more Netflix-ian approach</a> to delivering content. Here&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s described on the Basecamp website:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Students work through playlists of content at their own pace and take assessments on demand. They also work with teachers to set short-term and long-term goals and connect these back to their daily actions.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under the Facebook/Summit approach, time is no longer a constraint for students that have already mastered certain content, nor is it a limitation for students that may need more time to fully grasp a concept before moving on to the next lesson.</p>

<p>This represents a fundamental shift in the relationship between students,how they learn, and  the role of educators in supporting students through that process. The Basecamp platform is still in its infancy and has much room to develop, particularly to address the needs of students with ß or limited English proficiency. However, we should still recognize the potential this approach could have in changing how K-12 schools operate.</p>
