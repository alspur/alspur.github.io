     <p>What impact does a high-quality superintendent have on student performance? A new NBER paper by Victor Lavy and Adi Boiko investigates this question using data from schools in Israel, finding a significant effect on student achievement (.04 SD) for top-quality superintendents. From the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We exploit a quasi-random matching of superintendent and schools, and estimate that superintendent value added has positive and significant effects on primary and middle school students’ test scores in math, Hebrew, and English. One standard deviation improvement in superintendent value added increases test scores by about 0.04 of a standard deviation in the test score distribution. The effect doesn’t vary with students’ socio-economic background, is highly non-linear, increases sharply for superintendents in the highest-quartile of the value added distribution, and is larger for female superintendents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How did top-quality superintendents achieve these results? By improving the focus and clarity of school priorities and procedures, with an emphasis on improving school climate. The authors note the similarity of this management approach to <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/2014_injecting_charter_school_best_practices_into_traditional_public_schools.pdf">Fryer&rsquo;s 2014 study of Houston schools adopting a charter-style &ldquo;no excuses&rdquo; approach</a>.</p>

<p>The results of this study, along with Fryer&rsquo;s 2014 study, should inform the training and practice of superintendents in the United States. While successful superintendents will also likely need to develop and demonstrate competency in instructional leadership, finance, HR, and legal matters, the value-add of strength in these domains isn&rsquo;t as clear. Superintendents have the most impact on student outcomes when they help bring focus and clarity to schools while also emphasizing strong school culture. The leaders and programs that embrace this approach are likely to deliver better outcomes for their students in the long run.</p>

     <p>Do low-stakes international assessments of student performance accurately describe student ability? According to this recent NBER Working paper, a country&rsquo;s results may depend on their students&rsquo; intrinsic motivation to do well.</p>

<p>The authors used an experimental approach that offered treatment students a small financial incentive to do well on a test. Students in the treatment group were told just before the test that an envelope with the equivalent of $25 (US) was theirs, but that $1 would be subtracted for each incorrect answer. The researchers conducted the experiment in three high schools in China and two in the US. They found no impact of the financial incentive in China, but the effect size in the US was 0.20-0.23 standard deviations.</p>

<p>The authors conclude that the massive difference in treatment effect between countries indicates that &ldquo;success on low states assessments does not solely reflect differences in ability between students across countries&rdquo; and that &ldquo;low-stakes tests do not measure and compare ability in isolation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this in mind, researchers, policymakers, and the public should be a little more cautious when interpreting the results of low-stakes assessments like PISA. Student motivation clearly plays a significant role in the results of a country&rsquo;s performance - a topic that deserves further investigation. For example, NCES will release new <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/">NAEP results</a> in early 2018. Does student motivation vary significantly for NAEP across state lines? If so, how much of a role (if any) is it contributing to state performance?</p>

<p>Low-stakes assessments can be informative, but they may be measuring more than student ability. This study is a reminder to policymakers and advocates to exercise caution when comparing performance on these tests across jurisdictions.</p>

     <p><a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/">Tyler Cowen</a> recently interviewed <a href="https://twitter.com/Atul_Gawande">Atul Gawande</a> on his podcast, <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/commentary/conversations-tyler">Conversations with Tyler</a>. It’s a great episode and worth listening to the whole thing, but one section in particular stood out to me. From the <a href="https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/atul-gawande-checklist-books-tyler-cowen-d8268b8dfe53">transcript</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>COWEN: What’s the number one thing missing in medical education today, for doctors?</p>

<p>GAWANDE: I think the number one thing is an education around the fact that we are no longer a craft. It’s no longer an individual craft of being the smartest, most experienced, and capable individual. It’s a profession that has exceeded the capabilities of any individual to manage the volume of knowledge and skill required. So we are now delivering as groups of people. And knowing how to be an effective group, how to solve problems when your group is not being effective, and to enable that capability—that, I think, is not being taught, it’s not being researched. It is the biggest opportunity to advance human health, and we’re not delivering on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having worked in the education sector for a decade, it’s hard to listen to that and not consider replacing “medical education” with “educator preparation” and “human health” with “student outcomes.”</p>

<p>Teaching is certainly a craft that requires significant training, practice, and experience to master, but it also requires a high degree of collaboration with other teachers, administrators, support staff, parents, and students. Similar to medicine, it’s an under-taught, under-researched aspect of the profession.</p>

     <p>This was my second year attending the Strategic Data Project (SDP) Convening, the annual gathering of SDP Fellows and other education data nerds. There’s a ton of great content and conversation during the three days of Convening, here are some of the highlights from my perspective:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.twitter.com/rickhess99">Rick Hess</a> kicked off the 2017 Convening with a brief talk on his latest book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Letters-Education-Reformer-Educational-Innovations/dp/1682530221">Letters to a Young Education Reformer</a></em>. His writing has been a big influence on my thinking when it comes to education policy, so it was pretty great hearing him speak in person.</li>
<li>I really enjoyed hearing <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mpolikoff">Morgan Polikoff</a>, <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/thomas-kane">Tom Kane</a>, and Eric Hirsch (ED of <a href="http://www.edreports.org">EdReports</a>) discuss their work on curricular materials. Helping schools select higher-quality textbooks can have a significant impact on student learning - states and districts would be wise to pay attention to the work they&rsquo;re doing!</li>
<li>As is tradition at Convening, there is always a performance by a group of students after dinner on Thursday evening. This year, we were honored with readings from some of the <a href="http://www.826boston.org">student authors from 826 Boston</a>. Those kids are impressive.</li>
<li>It was great to see <a href="http://opensdp.github.io">Open SDP</a> launch on the final day of Convening. The entire SDP community (and more) will benefit from this open source approach to education data analysis. I&rsquo;m looking forward to contributing!</li>
</ul>

<p>I left the 2017 SDP Convening with many new ideas for improving how my team can apply our analytic skills to improve outcomes for students in Kentucky and beyond. Based on that alone, I&rsquo;d call this year&rsquo;s Convening a success.</p>

     <div class="article-content">
        
     

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/thinkschools">Alex Hernandez</a> argued that 43 percent of children in the United States are benefiting from school choice. <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/hernandez-devos-should-tell-her-critics-all-kids-deserve-school-choice-just-like-theirs-have">In The 74, he wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>School districts assign children to public schools based on where they live. Then, the world’s largest game of musical chairs begins. The families of 24 million students find ways around their forced assignments to get the schools they want for their kids.</p>

<p>The biggest school choice group is families who move to a new neighborhood to change their assigned school. They represent an estimated 8.2 million students, about one third of all school choosers. To be clear: The most popular way to choose a school in America is to literally move your family.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This led me to wonder: what kinds of families are able to choose a school for their child by moving? Thankfully, Hernandez shows his work in <a href="https://medium.com/@thinkschools/the-74-million-hernandez-devos-should-tell-her-critics-all-kids-deserve-school-choice-just-like-21d250c48e0f#.r6scv7i9l">a Medium post</a>, revealing the specific NCES reports he used to generate his estimates. His data comes from the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nhes/dataproducts.asp">NCES National Household Education Surveys Program</a>, specifically the Parent and Family Involvement in Education (PFI) survey.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, I was at an <a href="http://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu">SDP workshop</a> and heard from <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_j_bowers">Alex Bowers</a> on the kinds of research you can do with publicly-available education data, including NCES surveys.</p>

<p>I took this coincidence as a sign to take the advice of one Alex (Bowers) and extend the work of another Alex (Hernandez). All of the analysis below was performed using this publicly available data and <a href="https://github.com/alspur/nces_household_survey">the code is available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="who-are-the-movers">Who are the movers?</h2>

<p>Moving isn’t cheap. Families with more financial resources are more able to absorb the costs associated with moving to a neighborhood with a more desirable zoned school. Generally, as household income rises, students are more likely to have moved to their neighborhood specifically for the school. The following graph shows how frequently parents responding to the NCES survey decided to move neighborhoods for a better school, broken down by household income.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/nces_household_survey/master/figures/inc_move_pct.png" alt="inc_move_pct" /></p>

<p>The racial demographics of each income bracket vary. Higher-income movers are less racially diverse than lower-income movers.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/nces_household_survey/master/figures/race_inc_move.png" alt="race_in_move" /></p>

<p>Splitting the chart above by racial group, we can see how likely a family is to move given their race and their incomes. We can see that the groups most likely to move neighborhoods for better schools are white and Asian families with a six-figure household income.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/nces_household_survey/master/figures/race_inc_move_pct.png" alt="race_in_move_pct" /></p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-most-popular-destinations-for-movers">What are the most popular destinations for movers?</h2>

<p>The public NCES survey data doesn’t include precise location data, but it does provide the <strong>type</strong> of neighborhood where these families live. It’s not surprising to see that most movers head for the suburbs. For clarification on what separates a “suburb, large” from a “town, distant” check out <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ruraled/definitions.asp">their definitions on the NCES website</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/nces_household_survey/master/figures/zip_move.png" alt="zip_move" /></p>

<p>This chart shows the volume of movers by their chosen destination and their household income. It’s pretty clear that affluent families overwhelmingly choose to move to either suburbs or “rural, fringe” areas, defined as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Census-defined rural territory that is less than or equal to 5 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is less than or equal to 2.5 miles from an urban cluster</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/nces_household_survey/master/figures/inc_move_zip.png" alt="inc_move_zip" /></p>

<p>For lower-income families, suburbs are still a popular destination, but they are much more likely to choose cities or towns.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/nces_household_survey/master/figures/inc_move_zip_pct.png" alt="inc_move_zip_pct" /></p>

<p>Mover destinations by race reveal a consistent preference for suburbs, with varying degrees of preference for other destination types.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/nces_household_survey/master/figures/zip_race_move_pct.png" alt="zip_race_move_pct" /></p>

<p>I’ve only scratched the surface of what we can learn from this particular survey. It has a lot more information I’d like to investigate, including parents’ views on school quality, if their students are in their first-choice school, and more. The survey has also been administered in 2007, 2005, and 2003, so it would be interesting to track some of these patterns on both sides of the Great Recession.</p>

<p>Publicly-available education data is pretty cool.</p>
