      <p>Using data to inform our conversations about public school performance is a good idea, but too often, the measures we use are reduced to imprecise terms like &ldquo;proficiency,&rdquo; which can carry several different meanings when describing a local, state, or national assessment<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dynarski">Susan Dynarski</a> notes in The Upshot, this is also a common problem with the most-frequently used proxy for &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; in education, Free/Reduced Price Lunch (FRPL) eligibility:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly half of students nationwide are eligible for a subsidized meal in school. Children whose families earn less than 185 percent of the poverty threshold are eligible for a reduced-price lunch, while those below 130 percent get a free lunch. For a family of four, the cutoffs are $32,000 for a free lunch and $45,000 for a reduced-price one. By way of comparison, median household income in the United States was <a href="http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p60-252.pdf">about $54,000</a> in 2014.</p>

<p>Eligibility for subsidized school meals is clearly a blunt indicator of economic status. But that is the measure that policy makers, educators and researchers rely on when they gauge gaps in academic achievement in schools, districts and states.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In practice, this means that when we refer to FRPL students as &ldquo;economically disadvantaged,&rdquo; we&rsquo;re really painting with a broad brush. Thankfully, Dynarski and her co-author, Katherine Michelmore, devised a way to use current FRPL data to produce <a href="http://users.nber.org/~dynarski/w22474.pdf">a more precise picture of student economic disadvantage</a>: instead of looking at FRPL-eligibility in the current school year, we can use longitudinal datasets to look at how many <em>years</em> a student has been FRPL-eligible.</p>

<p>The concept is simple. If you were comparing two fifth grade students, student A and student B. If student A has been FRPL-eligible for a year and student B has been FRPL-eligible for five years, it&rsquo;s clear that student B has a greater economic disadvantage than student A.</p>

<p>Dynarski continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one ever actively decided that eligibility for subsidized meals was the best way to measure students’ economic disadvantage. The metric was widely available and became by default the standard way to distinguish between poorer and richer children. But it was always an imprecise measure, and we can do better at little cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen <a href="https://morganpolikoff.com/2016/07/12/a-letter-to-the-u-s-department-of-education/">researchers stand up to advocate for better ways to quantify &ldquo;proficiency&rdquo;</a> - I hope we see a similar movement by researchers to advocate for better measures of poverty. Supporting Dynarski&rsquo;s approach would be a good (and cost-efficient!) step in that direction.</p>

      <p>Michael Lind on the weakness of intellectuals&rsquo; approach to inequality:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The views of intellectuals about social reform tend to be warped by professional and personal biases, as well. In the U.S. the default prescription for inequality and other social problems among professors, pundits, and policy wonks alike tends to be: More education! Successful intellectuals get where they are by being good at taking tests and by going to good schools. It is only natural for them to generalize from their own highly atypical life experiences and propose that society would be better off if everyone went to college — natural, but still stupid and lazy. Most of the jobs in advanced economies — a majority of them in the service sector — do not require higher education beyond a little vocational training. Notwithstanding automation, for the foreseeable future janitors will vastly outnumber professors, and if the wages of janitors are too low then other methods — unionization, the restriction of low-wage immigration, a higher minimum wage — make much more sense than enabling janitors to acquire BAs, much less MAs and Ph.Ds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m a member of the very intellectual class Lind describes. I share his concern that our &ldquo;intellectual class&rdquo; is too isolated from the experiences of the majority of our fellow citizens and that this can lead to ideas/policies that would work great for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/books/review/charles-murray-examines-the-white-working-class-in-coming-apart.html?_r=0">Belmont but fail to address the needs of Fishtown</a>.</p>

<p>But does that mean the &ldquo;intellectual class&rdquo; solution of &ldquo;more education&rdquo; is the wrong answer?</p>

<p>Every year, fewer jobs are available to those with only a high school degree. If we want to expand opportunity for working class Americans, it means ensuring a greater portion earn a BA - it also means that we need more people completing career/technical education and earning 2-year degrees.</p>

<p>Lind argues for short-term protectionist solutions to address low wages: more unionization, less immigration, and higher minimum wages. These may sound attractive, but they are ultimately stopgap measures that don&rsquo;t address the systemic challenge in our economy, illustrated in the graphic below:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good visualization of the unequal distribution of the economic benefits of globalization. <a href="https://t.co/9fhx0Od6UM">pic.twitter.com/9fhx0Od6UM</a></p>&mdash; Marc Porter Magee (@marcportermagee) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcportermagee/status/747955262493958144">June 29, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Why did wages for the Western working class stagnate while the Asian middle class grew just as much as the income of the most affluent? As Yuval Levin explains in <a href="https://itun.es/us/MtS-_.l">The Fractured Republic</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In the 1950s, the nation produced more than half of the world’s total manufactured goods—a mind-boggling, if obviously transitory, advantage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The equality of the postwar era was a unique moment in American history, subsidized in large part by the devastating impact of WWII on competing economies. As other nations rebuilt and technology facilitated the rise of globalization, the wage premium for American labor withered away. Protectionist policies can only attempt to insulate against this trend - they don&rsquo;t address the fundamental challenge that work historically performed by high school graduates in the US can now increasingly be performed more cheaply abroad or by robots.</p>

<p>The long-term solution is obvious: more education (both career and college oriented) to help more people access highly-skilled jobs with high wages, but we also need to consider shorter-term solutions to help make this transition less disruptive <em>without resorting to protectionism</em>. This will certainly involve a re-thinking of our social welfare system, either by re-imagining <a href="http://abetterway.speaker.gov">A Better Way</a> to run our current system, or replacing it with something more radical, like a <a href="http://www.aei.org/press/in-our-hands-a-plan-to-replace-the-welfare-state-by-charles-murray/">Universal Basic Income</a>.</p>

<p>While I disagree with Lind&rsquo;s proposed solution to inequality, I agree that more members of the &ldquo;intellectual class&rdquo; need to get outside of our bubbles to better understand the lives of working class Americans. Our nation is currently a <a href="https://itun.es/us/MtS-_.l">fractured republic</a> and <a href="https://itun.es/us/2K5mA.l">coming apart</a> - those of us in the &ldquo;intellectual class&rdquo; need to actively work to reverse the isolation we experience and cultivate more relationships and empathy for people of all backgrounds in our society.</p>

      <p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stop-trying-to-be-creative/">This entire article</a> on creativity is worth a read, but one passage in particular caught my attention:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In one experiment a bipedal robot programmed to walk farther and farther actually ended up walking less far than one that simply was programmed to do something novel again and again, Stanley writes. Falling on the ground and flailing your legs doesn’t look much like walking, but it’s a good way to learn to oscillate, and oscillation is the most effective motion for walking. If you lock your objectives strictly on walking, you won’t hit that oscillation stepping stone. Stanley calls this the “objective paradox” — as soon as you create an objective, you ruin your ability to reach it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The objective paradox explains why NCLB&rsquo;s approach to accountability failed. It asked our schools to &ldquo;walk farther&rdquo; without a full appreciation for the complexity of what it would take to accomplish the task. Some schools were able to respond to this challenge and many students benefited as a result.</p>

<p>However, far too many schools were not equipped to meet the goals set by NCLB. Instead of allowing schools to &ldquo;flail and oscillate,&rdquo; NCLB drove them to focus on getting one step further down the path. As many have acknowledged, this had the unintended consequence of forcing schools to divert too much focus too reading and math instruction at the expense of other subjects and priorities that may have actually contributed to better reading and math comprehension.</p>

<hr />

<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say that setting goals for reading and math achievement isn&rsquo;t important, but to emphasize that too much focus on these goals can have a deleterious impact on student outcomes.</p>

<p>Education reformers (myself included) have an impatient desire for rapid change and improvement when we see public school system that fails to adequately serve students, particularly students of color, students with disabilities, and poor students. It&rsquo;s a perfectly reasonable position - these children don&rsquo;t have the luxury of time on their side. We are right to seek solutions now and not at some distant future date.</p>

<p>At the same time, we need to temper that relentless drive to improve the quality of public education for all children with the humility to understand two constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li>We don&rsquo;t know what the perfect system looks like.</li>
<li>Progress won&rsquo;t always be measured by annual, linear changes in math and reading scores.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many high-performing schools already understand this. <a href="https://www.twitter.com/mpolikoff">Morgan Polikoff</a> recently <a href="http://morganpolikoff.com/2015/12/11/my-visit-to-success-academies/">visited Success Academies in NYC</a> and observed that the instruction and culture of the school was nothing like the caricature of a test-obsessed, drill-and-kill school solely focused on boosting reading and math scores. Instead, he found that their primary goals for students in English/Language Arts are: &ldquo;for students to 1) love literature and want to read, and 2) be able to understand what they’re reading.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Polikoff also identifies several important structural elements that contribute to SA&rsquo;s success. This includes a strong emphasis on student-led dialogue, excellent classroom management procedures, and an instructional culture that embraces feedback/coaching. None of those structural elements, taken on their own, would allow a school to achieve math and reading  results similar to SA, but developing these systems (or other approaches) is analogous to the walking robot flailing and oscillating its legs. Getting them right won&rsquo;t directly lead to achieving success for students, but they&rsquo;re foundational prerequisites to ultimately achieving that success.</p>

<p>ESSA will give states the flexibility to develop accountability systems that acknowledge this better than NCLB-era accountability systems. States and the reform advocates holding them accountable would be wise to consider the objective paradox and grapple with the challenge of striking a balance between the competing desires for rapid improvement and allowing room for schools to develop solid fundamental practices.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The ink on the recently released Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) is barely dry, but progressive ed reformers are already panning the proposed successor to the defunct No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). <a href="http://twitter.com/conorpwilliams">Conor Williams</a> argues that not only should Obama veto the NCLB rewrite, <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/williams-why-progressives-should-fear-conservatives-should-hate-and-obama-should-veto-the-nclb-rewrite">progressives should fear it</a>.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:cons"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:cons">1</a></sup> His case for progressive opposition to ESSA boils down to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If this were a debate over clean water protections, voting rights protections, or most other policy issues, progressives would line up to yell about how states can’t be trusted to do the right thing without strong federal oversight.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This begs the question: what is &ldquo;the right thing&rdquo; for states to do? Is there even one &ldquo;right thing&rdquo; that can apply to all states? Reading Williams&rsquo; argument, I kept hearing the Hayek quote above in my head.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:econ"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:econ">2</a></sup> I&rsquo;m not as confident that we know enough to design the accountability system he imagines.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, <a href="http://twitter.com/michaelpetrilli">Mike Petrilli</a> wrote about <a href="http://edexcellence.net/articles/lets-check-our-halos-at-the-door-education-reformers">the ed reform movement&rsquo;s need for more humility</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We know what works, we just need the political will to do it”: That’s the foundational creed of today’s reform movement. But what if the truth is closer to “We are just beginning to learn what works to help poor kids escape poverty, but we still don’t know how to do it at scale”?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. As a movement, we&rsquo;ve made some significant progress in figuring out &ldquo;what works&rdquo;, but what we have learned is dwarfed by what we need to know in order to provide all students with a quality education. This means that we not only need to invest more in research (see <a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Greene.pdf">Jay Greene&rsquo;s writing</a> for more on that), but we should also encourage and evaluate new approaches. ESSA would give states a great opportunity to expand our understanding of &ldquo;what works&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Right now, it looks as if ESSA is likely to pass and that most of the education policy action will (rightfully) be at the state level. Instead of giving in to the &ldquo;fatal conceit&rdquo; Hayek describes, I hope that both progressive and conservative reformers embrace the opportunity to adopt accountability systems that will challenge and improve the status quo in ways that acknowledge the current limits of our policy tools.</p>

<li id="fn:cons">Williams also argues that conservatives should oppose ESSA because it replaces relatively simple and clear federal accountability measures with more latitude for states to design their own systems. For conservatives, that is a feature, not a bug, for conservatives.

<h3 id="the-growth-of-school-choice-in-connecticut-1995-2015">The Growth of School Choice in Connecticut, 1995-2015</h3>

<p>For years, families in Connecticut demanded more public school options for their children. Over the last two decades, state funding for magnet and charter schools grew significantly.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/choicefunding/master/choicegrants.png" alt="choiceGrants" /></p>

<p>Even with this level of growth, thousands still end up unable to attend <a href="http://articles.courant.com/2012-04-24/news/hc-school-lottery-0424-20120423_1_open-choice-open-three-new-magnet-choice-or-magnet-schools">magnet schools</a> or <a href="http://www.sde.ct.gov/sde/lib/sde/pdf/equity/charter/report_on_the_operation_of_charter_schools.pdf">charter schools</a> due to limited capacity. Wouldn&rsquo;t it seem reasonable that lawmakers would work to expand the number of public school options available to families?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Connecticut may be heading in the opposite direction. Some lawmakers are considering putting a moratorium on any further expansion of <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=HB6414&amp;which_year=2015">magnet schools</a> and <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=HB6003&amp;which_year=2015">charter schools</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="choice-funding-in-connecticut-too-big-to-exist-as-line-items">Choice funding in Connecticut: too big to exist as line-items?</h3>

<p>Simply put, the current system of funding school choice is expensive and downright Byzantine. A student can have their public education funded at least 10 different ways based on the type of school they attend.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> As the chart below indicates, this complicated system of funding is now equivalent to more than 15% of the main grant to school districts, the Education Cost Sharing grant (ECS).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/choicefunding/master/choiceratio.png" alt="choiceVsECS" /></p>

<p>Freezing funding to schools of choice would be an easy way for legislators to avoid answering a simple question: why should more than 50,000 students have their public schools funded in different and inequitable methods?</p>

<h3 id="what-s-the-solution">What&rsquo;s the solution?</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a <a href="http://ctmirror.org/2015/02/03/barnes-long-term-obligations-continue-to-squeeze-funding-for-poor-children/">lean budget year</a> with many tough short-term choices, but lawmakers need to think seriously about the future of our school finance system. I hope they keep these principles in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>All public school students should have their public education funded by a combination of the state and by their town of residence.</li>
<li>The ratio of state/town funding should be determined by the relative wealth of the town.</li>
<li>A student&rsquo;s total level of funding should be determined by their learning needs.</li>
<li>The full funding for a student should follow them to the public school of their choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>A funding system guided by these principles would benefit the state by focusing the school finance system on town wealth and student need instead of the label a public school carries. It would benefit towns by giving them a predictable level of costs - no matter what schools families choose, towns would contribute the same level of funding to their education. Most importantly, it would provide families with more choices for their children.</p>

      <p>What would happen if we actually followed the ECS formula?</p>

<p>There are two significant flaws in Connecticut&rsquo;s current school funding formula, known as ECS (Education Cost Sharing):</p>

<ol>
<li>It does not reflect the actual needs of towns and students.</li>
<li>It does not treat the thousands of students accessing school choice equitably.</li>
</ol>

<p>I plan on addressing those concerns in subsequent posts, but for a moment, let&rsquo;s take ECS at face value and assume that the underpinnings of the formula are correct. If political processes had not brought Connecticut off of the ECS formula and we distributed current funding according to the formula, how might that change how dollars flow to towns?</p>

<p>Right now, the ECS formula is somewhere around $650 million under-funded. That is to say, the legislature and governor have not found a way to follow the ECS formula as it was originally intended to operate. In lieu of actually following the formula, the money that flows from the state to towns to school districts has been manipulated by politicians each legislative session since the ECS formula was adopted.</p>

<p>What would happen if our elected representatives followed the distributive principles of the ECS formula, so that if the state could only contribute 80% of what the formula dictates, each town would receive 80% of what the ECS formula dictates they should receive?<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> Let&rsquo;s figure it out!</p>

<hr />

<p>In fiscal year 2015 (FY15), ECS was about 75% funded, meaning that the state is paying about three quarters to the dollar of what the ECS formula actually dictates.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME">shocked, shocked to learn</a> that some towns are earning more than 75% of their ECS entitlement, while other earn less!</p>

<p>Which towns are doing better/worse than they should be doing if current dollars were distributed based on the ECS formula?</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the biggest beneficiaries of the current distribution of ECS dollars tend to be <a href="http://www.sde.ct.gov/sde/cwp/view.asp?a=2683&amp;Q=334226">Alliance Districts</a>, a collection of 30 low-performing districts the Malloy administration placed a priority on supporting with additional funding (identified in the table with a *).</p>

<p>Twelve towns are under-funded by at least $5 million according to the current ECS formula. West Hartford falls $20 million short. Danbury is $17 million short and Milford is more than $11 million under-funded:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s surprising to see five Alliance Districts on this list (again, identified with a *). The combined under-funding of these five districts (Danbury, Norwalk, Middletown, Hamden, and Stamford) is about $43 million, which is less than the $60 million over-funding of the big three cities (Bridgeport, Hartford, and New Haven).</p>

<hr />

<p>Looking at raw dollar differences is helpful, but Connecticut is a state with a few large towns and many medium and small towns. Let&rsquo;s compare what towns receive now as a percentage of what they <em>ought to receive if we followed the ECS formula with current appropriations</em>:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/ecstargets/master/figures/ecsPctDiff.png" alt="pctDiffECS" /></p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re able to see which towns are really benefitting from the current flow of ECS funding. There are 53 towns in Connecticut that receive about 32% more ECS funding than they ought to, given the current level of total ECS appropriations. This includes affluent towns like Greenwich, Darien, Fairfield, Madison, and Westport.</p>

<p>Which towns get the short end of the stick? Well, there are a dozen towns that receive less than <em>half</em> what they ought to receive under the ECS formula:</p>

<p>The place I call home, Branford, gets less than a quarter on the dollar of what we <em>should</em> be getting according to ECS with the current level of total funding distributed via the ECS grant.</p>

<hr />

<p>Again, <em>I don&rsquo;t think the current ECS formula is correct</em>,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> but this thought experiment highlights the key challenges of reforming Connecticut&rsquo;s school finance system if we kept total spending flat:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;big three&rdquo; Alliance Districts are doing much better than other Alliance Districts.</strong> Connecticut&rsquo;s big three urban cities (Bridgeport, Hartford, and New Haven) are doing very well under the current flow of ECS dollars, which is in stark contrast to other high-needs towns that are significantly under-funded (Danbury, Norwalk, Middletown, Hamden, and Stamford). In order for the big three to gain funding, there needs to be either an increase in overall funding or adjustments to the ECS formula to more heavily weight for poverty.</li>
<li><strong>There are many (mostly affluent) towns that are receiving more than their fair share.</strong> Many towns have already hit the ceiling on what they should be getting under a fully-funded ECS formula. Any funding reform that gives more weight to towns with high poverty would mean reduced funding for these towns.</li>
<li><strong>Suburbs are getting a raw deal.</strong> While there are some Alliance Districts that are relatively under-funded, the most disadvantaged towns are middle-class suburbs like Branford, Orange, and West Hartford. These are towns that should be pushing for immediate school finance reform, since they would stand to see the largest relative increase in funding, even with no new money added to the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of waiting for a court to compel the legislature to change ECS, leaders of middle-class towns and Alliance Districts should be working to develop an school finance &ldquo;grand bargain&rdquo; that could be implemented without significant additional revenue. This would likely need to include schools of choice (magnets, charters, etc.) along with some sort of regulatory relief to affluent towns that would stand to lose funding.</p>

<p>Will any leaders take on this challenge?</p>

      <p>School finance in Connecticut is broken.</p>

<p>The state&rsquo;s main vehicle of support to public schools, the Education Cost Sharing (ECS) grant, sends $2 billion to local districts each year with the goal of equalizing the ability of communities to fund public education. Unfortunately, years of legislative tinkering with the ECS formula left Connecticut with <a href="ecsformula">a Byzantine approach to funding schools that takes more than 16 pages to explain</a>.</p>

<p>On top of this labyrinthine system, non-traditional public schools (including magnet, charter, vocational/technical, and agriscience schools) <a href="ecstaskforce">are funded under entirely separate mechanisms</a>. In practice, this means that one student could have their education funded up to ten different ways<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This approach makes the bulk of Connecticut&rsquo;s education aid unresponsive to the changing needs of communities and families across our state.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the wake of <a href="tax">the largest tax increase in state history</a> and with <a href="ctatrisk">major financial challenges looming</a>, it&rsquo;s not likely that our state will simply be able to address this problem with a significant cash infusion. <strong>We need to make difficult choices to improve how Connecticut allocates scarce resources for public education.</strong></p>

<p>In the state with <a href="achievementgap">the largest achievement gap in the nation</a>, we need a better way to provide a high-quality public education to every child. I believe that a more equitable and responsive school finance system is an necessary mechanism to achieve that goal.</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t be easy changing the status quo in <a href="steadyhabits">the land of steady habits</a>, but I&rsquo;m going to do my part to move the conversation in a productive direction. In this space, I plan on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Detailing the challenges and competing priorities involved in school finance reform.</li>
<li>Proposing policy approaches that take into account the educational challenges and fiscal realities facing our state.</li>
<li>Transparent analyses of school finance and demographic data. When possible, all code and data will be available on <a href="github">my GitHub page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Connecticut&rsquo;s school finance system is broken. We need to fix it my making some tough policy choices.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get to work.</p>
