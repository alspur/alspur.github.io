      <description>What impact does a high-quality superintendent have on student performance? A new NBER paper by Victor Lavy and Adi Boiko investigates this question using data from schools in Israel, finding a significant effect on student achievement (.04 SD) for top-quality superintendents. From the abstract:
 We exploit a quasi-random matching of superintendent and schools, and estimate that superintendent value added has positive and significant effects on primary and middle school students’ test scores in math, Hebrew, and English.</description>

      <description>Do low-stakes international assessments of student performance accurately describe student ability? According to this recent NBER Working paper, a country&amp;rsquo;s results may depend on their students&amp;rsquo; intrinsic motivation to do well.
The authors used an experimental approach that offered treatment students a small financial incentive to do well on a test. Students in the treatment group were told just before the test that an envelope with the equivalent of $25 (US) was theirs, but that $1 would be subtracted for each incorrect answer.</description>

      <description>Tyler Cowen recently interviewed Atul Gawande on his podcast, Conversations with Tyler. It’s a great episode and worth listening to the whole thing, but one section in particular stood out to me. From the transcript:
 COWEN: What’s the number one thing missing in medical education today, for doctors?
GAWANDE: I think the number one thing is an education around the fact that we are no longer a craft. It’s no longer an individual craft of being the smartest, most experienced, and capable individual.</description>

      <description>This was my second year attending the Strategic Data Project (SDP) Convening, the annual gathering of SDP Fellows and other education data nerds. There’s a ton of great content and conversation during the three days of Convening, here are some of the highlights from my perspective:
 Rick Hess kicked off the 2017 Convening with a brief talk on his latest book, Letters to a Young Education Reformer. His writing has been a big influence on my thinking when it comes to education policy, so it was pretty great hearing him speak in person.</description>

      <description>Earlier this week, Alex Hernandez argued that 43 percent of children in the United States are benefiting from school choice. In The 74, he wrote:
 School districts assign children to public schools based on where they live. Then, the world’s largest game of musical chairs begins. The families of 24 million students find ways around their forced assignments to get the schools they want for their kids.
The biggest school choice group is families who move to a new neighborhood to change their assigned school.</description>

      <description>E.D. Hirsch is a self-described &amp;ldquo;hedgehog,&amp;rdquo; viewing the world through the lens of one big idea:
 &amp;ldquo;[T]he achievement gap is chiefly a knowledge gap and a language gap. It can be greatly ameliorated by knowledge-based schooling.&amp;rdquo;
 The inverse of Hirsch&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;big idea&amp;rdquo; is the skills-based approach to education that drives instruction in the vast majority of American schools. The Schools We Need &amp;amp; Why We Don&amp;rsquo;t Have Them&amp;rdquo; was my first introduction to the &amp;ldquo;knowledge vs.</description>

      <description>After 11 years of litigation, Judge Thomas Moukawsher issued a seismic decision in the CCJEF school finance lawsuit. In the decision, Moukawsher not only eviscerated Connecticut&amp;rsquo;s school finance system, he also detailed flaws in the state&amp;rsquo;s approach to teacher evaluation, teacher compensation, the lack of clear definitions of success in elementary and secondary education, and gave the state 180 days to come up with a solution to all of it.</description>

      <description>If there&amp;rsquo;s one common thread between Robin Lake relating The Boys in the Boat to schools, Neerav Kingsland on a recent charter study, and Robert Pondiscio on Hillbilly Elegy, it&amp;rsquo;s that culture plays a huge role in education. A new NBER Working Paper provides powerful evidence that it may be even more critical than was previously understood.
The authors examine the performance of first and second generation immigrant students in Florida to understand the relationship between the &amp;ldquo;long-term orientation&amp;rdquo; of the cultures they come from to their educational outcomes.</description>

      <description>Chad Aldeman on the delegation of policy making in ESSA:
 Congress was able to reach broad bipartisan agreement on ESSA mainly because it punted on a number of key policy questions. Any reading of ESSA leaves one wondering what exactly Congress meant when it asked states to “meaningfully differentiate” among schools, when it required that states give “substantial weight” to each indicator, or when it stipulated that academic indicators count for “much greater weight” than non-academic ones.</description>

      <description>Five years ago, Marc Andressen took to the pages of the Wall Street Journal to describe how software was &amp;ldquo;eating the world&amp;rdquo;:
 &amp;ldquo;More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as online services—from movies to agriculture to national defense. Many of the winners are Silicon Valley-style entrepreneurial technology companies that are invading and overturning established industry structures. Over the next 10 years, I expect many more industries to be disrupted by software, with new world-beating Silicon Valley companies doing the disruption in more cases than not.</description>

      <description>Using data to inform our conversations about public school performance is a good idea, but too often, the measures we use are reduced to imprecise terms like &amp;ldquo;proficiency,&amp;rdquo; which can carry several different meanings when describing a local, state, or national assessment1.
As Susan Dynarski notes in The Upshot, this is also a common problem with the most-frequently used proxy for &amp;ldquo;poverty&amp;rdquo; in education, Free/Reduced Price Lunch (FRPL) eligibility:
 &amp;ldquo;Nearly half of students nationwide are eligible for a subsidized meal in school.</description>

      <description>Michael Lind on the weakness of intellectuals&amp;rsquo; approach to inequality:
 The views of intellectuals about social reform tend to be warped by professional and personal biases, as well. In the U.S. the default prescription for inequality and other social problems among professors, pundits, and policy wonks alike tends to be: More education! Successful intellectuals get where they are by being good at taking tests and by going to good schools.</description>

      <description>This entire article on creativity is worth a read, but one passage in particular caught my attention:
 In one experiment a bipedal robot programmed to walk farther and farther actually ended up walking less far than one that simply was programmed to do something novel again and again, Stanley writes. Falling on the ground and flailing your legs doesn’t look much like walking, but it’s a good way to learn to oscillate, and oscillation is the most effective motion for walking.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design&amp;rdquo; - F.A. Hayek, The Fatal Conceit
 The ink on the recently released Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) is barely dry, but progressive ed reformers are already panning the proposed successor to the defunct No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). Conor Williams argues that not only should Obama veto the NCLB rewrite, progressives should fear it.</description>

      <description>This entire series of conversations with Fishman Prize winners is worth reading, but this passage stood out to me:
 “In so many ways, these hierarchies we have put teachers at the bottom. But that almost entitles everyone who is above us, so to speak, to put tasks on our plate.”
 It perfectly captures my feelings after reading The Allure of Order and Team of Teams: our highly bureaucratized school system is limiting the potential of our students and our educators.</description>

      <description>The Growth of School Choice in Connecticut, 1995-2015 For years, families in Connecticut demanded more public school options for their children. Over the last two decades, state funding for magnet and charter schools grew significantly.
Even with this level of growth, thousands still end up unable to attend magnet schools or charter schools due to limited capacity. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it seem reasonable that lawmakers would work to expand the number of public school options available to families?</description>

      <description>What would happen if we actually followed the ECS formula?
There are two significant flaws in Connecticut&amp;rsquo;s current school funding formula, known as ECS (Education Cost Sharing):
 It does not reflect the actual needs of towns and students. It does not treat the thousands of students accessing school choice equitably.  I plan on addressing those concerns in subsequent posts, but for a moment, let&amp;rsquo;s take ECS at face value and assume that the underpinnings of the formula are correct.</description>

      <description>School finance in Connecticut is broken.
The state&amp;rsquo;s main vehicle of support to public schools, the Education Cost Sharing (ECS) grant, sends $2 billion to local districts each year with the goal of equalizing the ability of communities to fund public education. Unfortunately, years of legislative tinkering with the ECS formula left Connecticut with a Byzantine approach to funding schools that takes more than 16 pages to explain.
On top of this labyrinthine system, non-traditional public schools (including magnet, charter, vocational/technical, and agriscience schools) are funded under entirely separate mechanisms.</description>
