     <p>What impact does a high-quality superintendent have on student performance? A new NBER paper by Victor Lavy and Adi Boiko investigates this question using data from schools in Israel, finding a significant effect on student achievement (.04 SD) for top-quality superintendents. From the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We exploit a quasi-random matching of superintendent and schools, and estimate that superintendent value added has positive and significant effects on primary and middle school students’ test scores in math, Hebrew, and English. One standard deviation improvement in superintendent value added increases test scores by about 0.04 of a standard deviation in the test score distribution. The effect doesn’t vary with students’ socio-economic background, is highly non-linear, increases sharply for superintendents in the highest-quartile of the value added distribution, and is larger for female superintendents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How did top-quality superintendents achieve these results? By improving the focus and clarity of school priorities and procedures, with an emphasis on improving school climate. The authors note the similarity of this management approach to <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/2014_injecting_charter_school_best_practices_into_traditional_public_schools.pdf">Fryer&rsquo;s 2014 study of Houston schools adopting a charter-style &ldquo;no excuses&rdquo; approach</a>.</p>

<p>The results of this study, along with Fryer&rsquo;s 2014 study, should inform the training and practice of superintendents in the United States. While successful superintendents will also likely need to develop and demonstrate competency in instructional leadership, finance, HR, and legal matters, the value-add of strength in these domains isn&rsquo;t as clear. Superintendents have the most impact on student outcomes when they help bring focus and clarity to schools while also emphasizing strong school culture. The leaders and programs that embrace this approach are likely to deliver better outcomes for their students in the long run.</p>

     <p>Do low-stakes international assessments of student performance accurately describe student ability? According to this recent NBER Working paper, a country&rsquo;s results may depend on their students&rsquo; intrinsic motivation to do well.</p>

<p>The authors used an experimental approach that offered treatment students a small financial incentive to do well on a test. Students in the treatment group were told just before the test that an envelope with the equivalent of $25 (US) was theirs, but that $1 would be subtracted for each incorrect answer. The researchers conducted the experiment in three high schools in China and two in the US. They found no impact of the financial incentive in China, but the effect size in the US was 0.20-0.23 standard deviations.</p>

<p>The authors conclude that the massive difference in treatment effect between countries indicates that &ldquo;success on low states assessments does not solely reflect differences in ability between students across countries&rdquo; and that &ldquo;low-stakes tests do not measure and compare ability in isolation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this in mind, researchers, policymakers, and the public should be a little more cautious when interpreting the results of low-stakes assessments like PISA. Student motivation clearly plays a significant role in the results of a country&rsquo;s performance - a topic that deserves further investigation. For example, NCES will release new <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/">NAEP results</a> in early 2018. Does student motivation vary significantly for NAEP across state lines? If so, how much of a role (if any) is it contributing to state performance?</p>

<p>Low-stakes assessments can be informative, but they may be measuring more than student ability. This study is a reminder to policymakers and advocates to exercise caution when comparing performance on these tests across jurisdictions.</p>

     <p>Nowadays, Watson isn&rsquo;t just playing Jeopardy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Watson was tested on 1,000 cancer diagnoses made by human experts. In 99 percent of them, Watson recommended the same treatment as the oncologists.</p>

<p>In 30 percent of the cases, Watson also found a treatment option the human doctors missed. Some treatments were based on research papers that the doctors had not read — more than 160,000 cancer research papers are published a year. Other treatment options might have surfaced in a new clinical trial the oncologists had not yet seen announced on the web.</p>

<p>But Watson read it all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty cool to see the support Artificial Intelligence (AI) could provide to oncologists. As the research and knowledge base in medicine expands and increasing rates, it&rsquo;s impossible to expect every researcher to be up-to-date on the every study, technique, or drug released. AI can help doctors make better decisions by recommending treatments based on a significantly larger base of knowledge.</p>

<p>If Watson can help doctors, why couldn&rsquo;t it also help teachers?</p>

<p>In my opinion, it&rsquo;s not a question of if, but when teachers will get the same support from AI. Changing classroom practice based on education research has always been a challenge. Organizations like <a href="http://www.deansforimpact.org">Deans for Impact</a> are doing great work to <a href="http://deansforimpact.org/the_science_of_learning.html">promote good instructional practice based on cognitive science literature</a>, but it&rsquo;s really hard to scale.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;Watson for teachers&rdquo; could help lower the barriers between high-quality cognitive science, education research, and instructional practice. It may still be years away, but it will certainly help more teachers make better decisions to support student growth.</p>

<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m for the motion, but I would encourage you to watch and decide for yourself.</p>

     <p>A really neat concept that reminds me of my <a href="http://alspur.com/time-tracking/">time tracking method</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/">Jenny Bryan</a>, developer of the <a href="https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets">google sheets R package</a>, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/googlesheets-talk-at-user2015">gave a talk</a> at Use2015 about the package.</p>

<p>One of the things that got me most excited about the package was an example she gave in her talk of using the Google Sheets package for data collection at ultimate frisbee tournaments. One reason is that I used to play a little ultimate <a href="http://www.pbase.com/jmlane/image/76852417">back in the day</a>.</p>

<p>Another is that her idea is an amazing one for producing cool public health applications. One of the major issues with public health is being able to do distributed data collection cheaply, easily, and reproducibly. So I decided to write a little tutorial on how one could use <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a> and R to create a free distributed data collecton “app” for public health (or anything else really).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of hype around &ldquo;big data&rdquo; in every field, including education, but I&rsquo;m convinced there are many interesting questions that could be investigated at the school/district level with a &ldquo;small data&rdquo; approach supported by this workflow. There are obvious limitations - you wouldn&rsquo;t want to put individual student/teacher data in a public Google Sheet - but it&rsquo;s worth thinking about the kinds of programs/practices in schools that could benefit from research supported by distributed data collection.</p>
