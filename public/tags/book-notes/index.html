<p>E.D. Hirsch is a self-described &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox">hedgehog</a>,&rdquo; viewing the world through the lens of one big idea:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;[T]he achievement gap is chiefly a knowledge gap and a language gap. It can be greatly ameliorated by knowledge-based schooling.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The inverse of Hirsch&rsquo;s &ldquo;big idea&rdquo; is the skills-based approach to education that drives instruction in the vast majority of American schools. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Schools-We-Need-Dont-Have/dp/0385495242/">The Schools We Need &amp; Why We Don&rsquo;t Have Them</a>&rdquo; was my first introduction to the &ldquo;knowledge vs. skills&rdquo; debate. This book re-introduces Hirsch&rsquo;s basic case and extends it based on new evidence from the world of cognitive science and the experience of French schools over the past several decades.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-idea">The Big Idea</h2>

<p>Reading, critical thinking, and problem solving are not general skills that can be developed and applied to any context. Like most human skills, they are domain-specific, becoming stronger or weaker based on a person&rsquo;s background knowledge of the topic. Hirsch recommends providing all students with a curriculum in the early grades that focuses on developing knowledge, not skills, to promote equity and achievement among all students.</p>

<h2 id="key-passages">Key Passages</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard many well-intentioned people, including educators, state that in the age of Google, it&rsquo;s less important for students to learn a bunch of information they could just look up. Their belief is that we need to equip students with the critical thinking and problem solving skills to apply these tools to the problems they are tackling.</p>

<p>Hirsch provides a great deal of evidence to support the need focusing on building knowledge instead of generalizable skills, but the most powerful rebuttal to this line of thinking is his explanation of the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">Matthew Effect</a>&rdquo; in education:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reference works, inlcluding those available on the Internet, are immensely valuable to already knowledgeable people. Google is not an equal-opportunity fact-finder; it rewards those already in the know. Instead of being an agent of equality, Google rewards cognitive insiders. It consolidates educational inequity. Just as it takes money to make money, it takes knowledge to gain knowldege.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the book, Hirsch shows how the shift from a universal knowledge-based curriculum in France to a locally-determined and skills-focused approach in 1990 led to disastrous results:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The new localizing and indivudalizing of the schools had been proposed as a way of overcoming the reproduction of social stratification. But the educational results went the opposite way, intensifying inequalities. As the French data from 1987 to 2007 show, the new 1990 arrangements greatly intensified the social reproduction they were supposed to diminish. They systematically deprived poor children of the enabling knowledge that rich children had acquired from their home environments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hirsch&rsquo;s proposed solution, replacing a individual-focused reading curriculum based on &ldquo;leveled readers&rdquo; with a knowledge-centered communal curriculum, is paradoxically a better way to encourage students to develop as individuals:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It must not be assumed that a different approach - whole-class instruction of real books and subject matters - means grey uniformity. On the contrary, real knowledge breeds real interest and individuality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This principle is extended later in the book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s in relation to the community that the individual develops. Only by mastering the shared knowledge and norms of the community can one diverge from those norms effectively.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Core Knowledge curriculum, developed by Hirsch, is one approach to empowering students with a foundation of communal knowledge. He acknowledges that there can be <em>some</em> differentiation in early grade curricula based on local values while still building a strong foundation of knowledge:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rival elementary curriculums may reflect rival values but all responsible ones will exhibit a great deal of overlap - out of a sense of obligation to the children who will need knowledge represented by those words in order to function well in American society.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="actionable-items">Actionable Items</h2>

<p>Hirsch makes a convincing case for the power of a content-rich, coherent, and cumulative curriculum to build a strong foundation of literacy. While <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/never-judge-a-book-by-its-cover-use-student-achievement-instead/">research has shown the strong impact of a high-quality curriculum on student achievement</a>, there&rsquo;s a paucity of publicly available data on school curriculum. In some cases, <a href="https://morganpolikoff.com/2016/01/14/an-awful-lot-of-districts-dont-know-what-textbooks-are-used-in-their-schools/">districts may not even know</a> which textbooks are being used in their classrooms.</p>

<p>One can agree or disagree with the case Hirsch makes, but we should all be able to agree that curricular choices play an important role in student achievement. It would make sense to make information about those choices more transparent so that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Educators would know which schools/districts are using similar/identical approaches, creating opportunities for highly relevant cross-school/district collaboration.</li>
<li>Researchers could evaluate the relative strength/weakness of curriculum implemented in public schools.</li>
<li>School boards and local school councils would have significantly more information to inform adoption/renewal of curriculum.</li>
</ol>

<p>None of this is possible without transparent data on curriculum. Collecting information about such an important component of public education shouldn&rsquo;t require a FOIA request.</p>

<p>Books have always been important to me. My grandmother was a librarian and as she babysat me, I was able to spend hundreds, if not thousands, of hours searching, consuming, and falling in love with books. That passion continues today, but I find that I have less time to devote to extended, deep periods of reading.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to follow <a href="http://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/bird-by-bird">CGP Grey&rsquo;s lead and start publicly sharing notes on books I&rsquo;ve read</a>. Here&rsquo;s his explanation of why he started:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to attempt, for a little while anyway, to make public some of my notes from some of the books that I&rsquo;ve read. This is partly because people are forever asking what I&rsquo;m reading, but it&rsquo;s mostly as a way to try and encourage myself to read both more deeply and more frequently &ndash; a target I have been trying, and failing, to hit for all my adult life.</p>

<p>All projects and hobbies of mine eventually die from lack of attention if they cannot serve multiple purposes. So it is my hope that these notes will add even more reason to engage more frequently with long-form writing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t anything close to a public clamor for my reading list, but I do hope that this practice helps me with his second goal - increasing my incentives to read books with more depth and more frequency. Additionally, I hope that formalizing this process will help me draw better connections between the books I read and what it could mean for education and/or individual productivity.</p>

<p>With that said, I&rsquo;m going to apply Grey&rsquo;s template to the last book I finished, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right/dp/0312430000/"><em>The Checklist Manifesto</em></a>:</p>

<h2 id="the-big-idea">The Big Idea</h2>

<p>Professionals of all varieties - programmers, doctors, teachers, pilots, etc. - perform cognitively demanding tasks on regular basis in high-stakes settings. They apply the skills they&rsquo;ve honed through training, their understanding of their field, and their general experience to execute complex tasks. But no matter how competent or prepared these professionals are, they still make mistakes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In a complex environment, experts are up against two main difficulties. The first is the fallibility of human memory and attention, especially when it comes to mundane, routine matters that are easily overlooked under the strain of more pressing events.”</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>“A further difficulty, just as insidious, is that people can lull themselves into skipping steps even when they remember them. In complex processes, after all, certain steps don’t always matter. Perhaps the elevator controls on airplanes are usually unlocked and a check is pointless most of the time. Perhaps measuring all four vital signs uncovers a worrisome issue in only one out of fifty patients. “This has never been a problem before,” people say. Until one day it is.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with confidence in your ability to practice your profession, but it does breed a degree hubris that even when seemingly benign, can lead to significant errors. Gwande provides several examples of this in the medical field, where skipping seemingly obvious steps can lead to someone having their right knee opened up even if they&rsquo;re in for an ACL repair on their left knee.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to see how this could translate to the classroom. A teacher might typically use exit tickets to gauge how much students understood the concepts taught in each lesson. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine a scenario where the teacher assumes a lesson went well and forgoes this step. This may only happen once in a while, but it could be the case that while the lesson seemed to go well, students actually misunderstood the concept that was taught. It&rsquo;s a much lower-stakes situation than a botched surgery, but even this small disruption could alter the success and pacing of future lessons.</p>

<p>The concept of minimizing mistakes in routine processes is also applicable to data analysis. Each data analysis project involves follows the broad format of importing, cleaning, transforming, and reporting data. If small steps along the way aren&rsquo;t double-checked, a tiny error can lead to significant problems with the results.</p>

<p>Gwande stresses that using checklists to minimize error isn&rsquo;t meant to dumb down the work of professionals. Instead, he argues that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It is common to misconceive how checklists function in complex lines of work. They are not comprehensive how-to guides, whether for building a skyscraper or getting a plane out of trouble. They are quick and simple tools aimed to buttress the skills of expert professionals. And by remaining swift and usable and resolutely modest, they are saving thousands upon thousands of lives.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="key-passages">Key Passages</h2>

<p>When the B-17 bomber was developed in the mid-1930&rsquo;s, it was the most complex aircraft ever built. It had four engines when nearly every plane had one or maybe two engines. This, along with the plane&rsquo;s other features, made the task of piloting it incredibly complex. The first time the plane was tested, it crashed shortly after takeoff not due to any mechanical issue, but to pilot error. The new design was simply too complex for one person to manage on their own.</p>

<p>Development on the plane continued and another test flight was scheduled. This time, the pilots developed what is now a staple of aviation: a checklist. It was concise, but it ultimately helped flight crews man the B-17 without incident from that point forward.</p>

<p>I found this to be a terrific example of intellectual humility by the test pilots. They were extremely well-trained, but they were willing to admit to themselves that while they were experts, their brains weren&rsquo;t reliable enough to ensure perfect execution every single time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Substantial parts of what software designers, financial managers, firefighters, police officers, lawyers, and most certainly clinicians do are now too complex for them to carry out reliably from memory alone. Multiple fields, in other words, have become too much airplane for one person to fly.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Educators and data analysts alike find themselves with &ldquo;too much airplane&rdquo; right now. We need to have the humility to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Admit that these are jobs we can&rsquo;t do alone.</li>
<li>Develop tools to help overcome the problem of &ldquo;too much airplane.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="actionable-items">Actionable Items</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“You want people to make sure to get the stupid stuff right. Yet you also want to leave room for craft and judgment and the ability to respond to unexpected difficulties that arise along the way”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Checklists must strike an important balance. They need to cover enough critical points in a process to minimize the &ldquo;stupid stuff&rdquo; that could happen, but they also need the flexibility and brevity to be useful in a real-world setting. Gwande explains the difference between a good checklist and a bad one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Bad checklists are vague and imprecise. They are too long; they are hard to use; they are impractical. They are made by desk jockeys with no awareness of the situations in which they are to be deployed. They treat the people using the tools as dumb and try to spell out every single step. They turn people’s brains off rather than turn them on.</p>

<p>Good checklists, on the other hand, are precise. They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use even in the most difficult situations. They do not try to spell out everything—a checklist cannot fly a plane. Instead, they provide reminders of only the most critical and important steps—the ones that even the highly skilled professionals using them could miss. Good checklists are, above all, practical.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After developing a good, concise checklist comes the most critical step: implementation. As Gwande first developed his surgical checklist, he practiced using it with his surgical team to figure out what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and how they could improve it <em>before</em> using it in an actual surgical setting.</p>

<p>Once the checklist was tested, it needed to gain adoption with other surgeons and their teams. Gwande started introducing it to chief surgeons - the idea was that if a hospital&rsquo;s leadership was able to embrace the change, others would follow. This is exactly what happened, and the incidence of surgical errors began to drop. But then something else began to happen:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Spot surveys of random staff members coming out of surgery after the checklist was in effect did indeed report a significant increase in the level of communication. There was also a notable correlation between teamwork scores and results for patients—the greater the improvement in teamwork, the greater the drop in complications.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The checklist process actually helped keep surgical teams more aware of what each person was doing by establishing a template for regular communication between everyone in the operating room. It&rsquo;s an example of the hidden benefit of checklists:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Just ticking boxes is not the ultimate goal here. Embracing a culture of teamwork and discipline is.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Setting up checklists can not only improve processes, it can help build stronger teams. For educators and analysts alike, that&rsquo;s a goal worthy of pursuit.</p>
