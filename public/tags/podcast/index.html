     <p><a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/">Tyler Cowen</a> recently interviewed <a href="https://twitter.com/Atul_Gawande">Atul Gawande</a> on his podcast, <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/commentary/conversations-tyler">Conversations with Tyler</a>. It’s a great episode and worth listening to the whole thing, but one section in particular stood out to me. From the <a href="https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/atul-gawande-checklist-books-tyler-cowen-d8268b8dfe53">transcript</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>COWEN: What’s the number one thing missing in medical education today, for doctors?</p>

<p>GAWANDE: I think the number one thing is an education around the fact that we are no longer a craft. It’s no longer an individual craft of being the smartest, most experienced, and capable individual. It’s a profession that has exceeded the capabilities of any individual to manage the volume of knowledge and skill required. So we are now delivering as groups of people. And knowing how to be an effective group, how to solve problems when your group is not being effective, and to enable that capability—that, I think, is not being taught, it’s not being researched. It is the biggest opportunity to advance human health, and we’re not delivering on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having worked in the education sector for a decade, it’s hard to listen to that and not consider replacing “medical education” with “educator preparation” and “human health” with “student outcomes.”</p>

<p>Teaching is certainly a craft that requires significant training, practice, and experience to master, but it also requires a high degree of collaboration with other teachers, administrators, support staff, parents, and students. Similar to medicine, it’s an under-taught, under-researched aspect of the profession.</p>

     <p>The most recent episode of <em>Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> starts off with a discussion of buying and assembling and AR-15 from scratch. It&rsquo;s an interesting process, but the conversation took an even more interesting turn as they focused on the decline of a tinkering ethos in our society.</p>

<p>The machines and devices we use are often too complex to repair, disassemble, or customize. If you open the hood of your car, you won&rsquo;t be able to see or even access many of the most critical parts - you&rsquo;ll most likely see a series of injection-molded plastic meant to not only protect but to discourage amateur tinkering. It is more likely that you&rsquo;ll be able to tinker with your car by software (via OBD-II compatible devices like <a href="https://www.automatic.com/home/">Automatic</a>) than by mechanical manipulation.</p>

<p>Understanding how to tinker/hack software is an increasingly valuable skill, but we should also recognize and cultivate the ability to take apart, assemble, fix, and customize physical objects. The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">Maker Movement</a> is a great example of keeping mechanical tinkering alive by encouraging kids and adults alike to get their hands dirty by blending both digital and physical craftsmanship.</p>

<p>As more of our lives become digitized, I hope that we continue to find ways to maintain some form of physical tinkering.</p>

     <p>I tweeted this out earlier today:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Insights from time tracking: I need to do more <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash">#rstats</a> programming on Thursday/Friday afternoons. Also, mtgs suck. <a href="https://t.co/14dFtGNubP">pic.twitter.com/14dFtGNubP</a></p>&mdash; Alex Spurrier (@alspur) <a href="https://twitter.com/alspur/status/759097342435917824">July 29, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Why do I have time tracking charts that break down when I do certain kinds of work?</p>

<p>A book (<a href="https://itun.es/us/mqIh7.l">Deep Work</a>) and a podcast (<a href="http://relay.fm/cortex">Cortex</a>).</p>

<p>I know that the ability to focus is important to the work I do, but <a href="https://itun.es/us/mqIh7.l">Deep Work</a> by Cal Newport helped articulate precisely <em>why</em> it&rsquo;s extremely important to cultivate the ability to perform &ldquo;deep work.&rdquo; I recommend reading the book, but the tl;dr is that in order to succeed in today&rsquo;s economy, one needs to be able to perform extremely cognitively demanding work with speed and quality. In order to accomplish that kind of work, one needs to be able to &ldquo;focus intently without distraction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The constant stream of email, texts, meetings, and phone calls that are commonplace in modern offices help keep us informed and connected to our coworkers, but it often prevents us from being able to maintain sustained periods of focus on cognitively demanding tasks. Newport makes several recommendations to combat distraction, but I found the most helpful advice was to schedule every minute of my day.</p>

<p>The purpose of scheduling every minute of your day isn&rsquo;t to hold yourself to an itinerary without any allowance for deviations. Instead, it&rsquo;s a way to be more intentional about how you&rsquo;re spending your time. More importantly, it can help you better track the amount of deep work you&rsquo;re actually accomplishing.</p>

<p>I currently use my calendar as a guide for how I&rsquo;m going to spend my week. There are always meetings I have to work around, but every other minute at work is allocated to a specific type of work. Despite my best intentions, reality doesn&rsquo;t always align with the calendar I set, so I needed another system to help me better track the work I actually accomplish.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://relay.fm/cortex">Cortex</a>.</p>

<p>Cortex is a podcast featuring <a href="http://www.twitter.com/imyke">Myke Hurley</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/cgpgrey">C.G.P. Grey</a> talking about how they get their work done. In their third episode, <a href="cortex3lcp">Grey reveals</a> that he uses <a href="https://appsto.re/us/gSEQV.i">Launch Center Pro</a> and <a href="https://appsto.re/us/XoZpx.i">Due</a> as a time tracking system. The workflow goes something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start a 40 minute timer in Due &amp; begin working</li>
<li>When the timer goes off, open Launch Center Pro, which has several actions associated with a specific type of work you do</li>
<li>Trigger the action associated with the work you just performed, which adds a row to a spreadsheet detailing the time and type of work you&rsquo;re doing.</li>
<li>Reset timer and continue working.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like any good nerd, I&rsquo;ve tweaked this system a little. I&rsquo;ve integrated <a href="https://appsto.re/us/BTL91.i">Drafts</a> actions with the Launch Center Pro actions so I can capture a little more context about the work I&rsquo;m doing. I also use <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a> to convert the spreadsheet of my time tracking data into charts in a PDF that help me understand how I&rsquo;m spending my time.</p>

<p>This took a little bit of work to set up, but it&rsquo;s been extremely helpful. Every Friday afternoon, I look at the PDF produced by the R Markdown script I wrote a few months ago. It&rsquo;s helped me realize how productive I am before 9am. I now make sure that before I leave the office, I&rsquo;m clear on the work I want to tackle the first thing the following morning. Conversely, looking at the data also shows me I still have to work on making the afternoons on Thursdays and Fridays more productive.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in improving your capacity for deep work, start with tracking your time.</p>
