      <description>This entire series of conversations with Fishman Prize winners is worth reading, but this passage stood out to me:
 “In so many ways, these hierarchies we have put teachers at the bottom. But that almost entitles everyone who is above us, so to speak, to put tasks on our plate.”
 It perfectly captures my feelings after reading The Allure of Order and Team of Teams: our highly bureaucratized school system is limiting the potential of our students and our educators.</description>
