      <description>The publication of a Capstone Report is the culmination of the Strategic Data Project&amp;rsquo;s Fellowship. These reports highlight the impact Fellows have on their respective education agencies. There are more than thirty Capstone reports on the SDP website, sorted into four broad categories:
 Data Capacity, Quality, &amp;amp; Culture Teacher Effectiveness Post-secondary Access &amp;amp; Success School Improvement &amp;amp; Redesign  This gives us a general idea of the topics Fellows were covering in their reports, but it would be nice to get a little more detail without having to read more than two dozen reports.</description>
