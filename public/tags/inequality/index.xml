      <description>Michael Lind on the weakness of intellectuals&amp;rsquo; approach to inequality:
 The views of intellectuals about social reform tend to be warped by professional and personal biases, as well. In the U.S. the default prescription for inequality and other social problems among professors, pundits, and policy wonks alike tends to be: More education! Successful intellectuals get where they are by being good at taking tests and by going to good schools.</description>
