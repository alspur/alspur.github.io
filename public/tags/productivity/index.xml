      <description>Books have always been important to me. My grandmother was a librarian and as she babysat me, I was able to spend hundreds, if not thousands, of hours searching, consuming, and falling in love with books. That passion continues today, but I find that I have less time to devote to extended, deep periods of reading.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to follow CGP Grey&amp;rsquo;s lead and start publicly sharing notes on books I&amp;rsquo;ve read.</description>

      <description>I tweeted this out earlier today:
Insights from time tracking: I need to do more #rstats programming on Thursday/Friday afternoons. Also, mtgs suck. pic.twitter.com/14dFtGNubP

Why do I have time tracking charts that break down when I do certain kinds of work?
A book (Deep Work) and a podcast (Cortex).
I know that the ability to focus is important to the work I do, but Deep Work by Cal Newport helped articulate precisely why it&amp;rsquo;s extremely important to cultivate the ability to perform &amp;ldquo;deep work.</description>
