<h3 id="the-growth-of-school-choice-in-connecticut-1995-2015">The Growth of School Choice in Connecticut, 1995-2015</h3>

<p>For years, families in Connecticut demanded more public school options for their children. Over the last two decades, state funding for magnet and charter schools grew significantly.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/choicefunding/master/choicegrants.png" alt="choiceGrants" /></p>

<p>Even with this level of growth, thousands still end up unable to attend <a href="http://articles.courant.com/2012-04-24/news/hc-school-lottery-0424-20120423_1_open-choice-open-three-new-magnet-choice-or-magnet-schools">magnet schools</a> or <a href="http://www.sde.ct.gov/sde/lib/sde/pdf/equity/charter/report_on_the_operation_of_charter_schools.pdf">charter schools</a> due to limited capacity. Wouldn&rsquo;t it seem reasonable that lawmakers would work to expand the number of public school options available to families?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Connecticut may be heading in the opposite direction. Some lawmakers are considering putting a moratorium on any further expansion of <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=HB6414&amp;which_year=2015">magnet schools</a> and <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=HB6003&amp;which_year=2015">charter schools</a>.</p>

<h3 id="choice-funding-in-connecticut-too-big-to-exist-as-line-items">Choice funding in Connecticut: too big to exist as line-items?</h3>

<p>Simply put, the current system of funding school choice is expensive and downright Byzantine. A student can have their public education funded at least 10 different ways based on the type of school they attend.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> As the chart below indicates, this complicated system of funding is now equivalent to more than 15% of the main grant to school districts, the Education Cost Sharing grant (ECS).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alspur/choicefunding/master/choiceratio.png" alt="choiceVsECS" /></p>

<p>Freezing funding to schools of choice would be an easy way for legislators to avoid answering a simple question: why should more than 50,000 students have their public schools funded in different and inequitable methods?</p>

<h3 id="what-s-the-solution">What&rsquo;s the solution?</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a <a href="http://ctmirror.org/2015/02/03/barnes-long-term-obligations-continue-to-squeeze-funding-for-poor-children/">lean budget year</a> with many tough short-term choices, but lawmakers need to think seriously about the future of our school finance system. I hope they keep these principles in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>All public school students should have their public education funded by a combination of the state and by their town of residence.</li>
<li>The ratio of state/town funding should be determined by the relative wealth of the town.</li>
<li>A student&rsquo;s total level of funding should be determined by their learning needs.</li>
<li>The full funding for a student should follow them to the public school of their choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>A funding system guided by these principles would benefit the state by focusing the school finance system on town wealth and student need instead of the label a public school carries. It would benefit towns by giving them a predictable level of costs - no matter what schools families choose, towns would contribute the same level of funding to their education. Most importantly, it would provide families with more choices for their children.</p>
