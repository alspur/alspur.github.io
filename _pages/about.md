**@alspur** is written and maintained by Alex Spurrier, a data scientist working in the education sector. He was a [Strategic Data Project Fellow](http://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu)[^1] and is a proud graduate of [Bethel University](http://www.bethel.edu) and [Trinity College](http://www.trincoll.edu). In addition to education-related issues, Alex is interested in technology, books, podcasts, and his beloved New England Patriots.

Some posts have a special icon next to the headline - here's how to figure out what it means and where it leads:

- <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> **= Linked Post**. This icon indicates a link post - a typically brief post reacting to/referencing an external article. Clicking on the <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> will take you from **@alspur** and to that article.
- <i class="fa fa-rss" aria-hidden="true"></i> **= Linked [Overcast](http://overcast.fm) Post**. This icon indicates a link post reacting to/referencing a particular podcast episode. Clicking on the <i class="fa fa-rss" aria-hidden="true"></i> will take you from **@alspur** and to the Overcast website[^2] and start playing the podcast at the relevant time.
- <i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i> **= Book Note**. This icon indicates a Book Note - my way of systematizing how I think about and apply lessons from the books I read. Clicking on the <i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i> will take you to the Amazon page for the book my notes are referencing.
